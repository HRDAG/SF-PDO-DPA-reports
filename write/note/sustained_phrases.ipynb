ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The co-complainant stated that the named officer’s statement attached to the incident report was inaccurate. She denied that the scene was out of control and denied that the officer had his star on his outermost clothing and identified himself. The officer denied the allegation. He stated he announced himself as a police officer and wore his police tar on his outermost clothing. A photo taken by a witness at the scene indicated the named officer had his police star on his outermost clothing while at the scene. Department records indicated that an officer on patrol viewed a physical altercation in progress and as the officer attempted to break up the altercation, other parties interfered prompting the officer to request additional units. The evidence proved that the act alleged in the complaint did not occur, or the named member was not involved in the act alleged.

      "SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS #3 continued: At 9:33 p.m., the victim called 911, stated that she and her roommate had called earlier and that she wa getting more scared because of it being an escalating domestic situation. Dispatch informed her that the officers were on scene. One of the named officers understood the call for service involved a boyfriend and girlfriend arguing and the boyfriend was outside, ringing the doorbell. The officers found the ex-boyfriend sitting on the front teps of the apartment, between the locked metal gate and the front door. The officers pat-searched the ex-boyfriend for weapons and found none. One of the named officers recalled that the ex-boyfriend appeared somewhat under the influence. The victim spoke with one of the named officers, said that she and her ex-boyfriend had argued earlier in the evening and she had asked him to move out. According to one of the named officers, she denied that her ex-boyfriend was trying to break in and the officer found no ign of damage on the door. The victim said the ex-boyfriend was ringing the doorbell incessantly. She tated they had dated for about two years before breaking up and that he had called recently to say he wa homeless and she felt sorry for him and allowed him to stay with her. The victim’s roommate came outside and informed one of the named officers that the ex-boyfriend had tried to put rat poison in the victim’s spaghetti. According to the named officer, the victim denied that the ex-boyfriend would do such a thing to hurt her, said she had eaten the spaghetti and felt fine and showed the named officer the spaghetti sauce which appeared to have a green substance that looked like a garnish. Based on the victim’s assertions, the named officer concluded the spaghetti had not been poisoned. He did not inform any other officer about the spaghetti poisoning until after the murder. According to the victim’s roommate, he showed one of the named officers the burrito wrapper with sauce because the victim was downplaying the incident. The roommate stated that the named officer shrugged at his request to have the sauce tested for poison. The roommate went back upstairs with the burrito wrapper. The named officers determined that no domestic violence crime had occurred and that the incident involved only a verbal argument. This conclusion was based on the victim’s denial that her ex-boyfriend had tried to hurt her in any way or that she felt threatened. Additionally, her demeanor was very calm. According to one of the named officers, the victim agreed that the solution was for the ex-boyfriend to leave and stay with a relative who lived in the East Bay. The ex-boyfriend agreed and the officer watched the ex-boyfriend leave while the victim returned to her apartment.
