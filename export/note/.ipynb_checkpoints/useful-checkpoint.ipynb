The complainant is an activist for an international movement that advocates for the rights of individuals to appear nude in public. The complainant contends that his appearing nude in public is not a violation of Penal Code section 314 because he does not do anything that can be considered “lewd.” Department training, which is based on POST Learning Domain LD-10, instructs officers in the elements of Penal Code section 314, but does not include examples where the suspect’s subjective intentions are to make a statement about nudity per se.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         9\n",

She stated the named officer was not wearing a mask and wa not 6 feet away from shoppers. The named officer stated he always wore a mask except when drinking or eating, and when adjusting it. He also confirmed that he was familiar with Department Notice 20-094 and acknowledged that he wa required to wear his mask. He also stated that there was no specific mask that he was required to wear, any face covering was fine as long it was not the mask that has the valve. The retail store promised to provide DPA with video surveillance of the incident; however, they never ent DPA a copy of the video.

The named officer did not recall stopping or refusing the entry of a Black shopper in the store, a described by the complainant. The named officer stated that he always performs his duties as a professional and with courtesy and respect. Given the preponderance of the evidence standard, and that the complainant did not hear the conversation between the Black shopper and the named officer, the complainant did not know why the shopper did not enter the store. The complainant had no factual basis to conclude that the Black shopper did not enter the tore because the named officer did not allow the shopper to enter, as opposed to many other reasons a person might not go into a store.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The complainant stated that he parked his car in a legal parking space to get directions from his cell phone when officers driving by stopped and questioned him for no reason. The named officer stated he was patrolling the area when he observed the complainant’s vehicle missing a front license plate. The named officer stated that the complainant was in violation of CVC 5200(a), which mandates that vehicles issued two license plates shall have both of them attached. The named officer also observed that the complainant was parked in a red zone in violation of CVC 21458 (a)(1). The named officer explained that the complainant did not respond to his request for identification and was very uncooperative, difficult, and argumentative, which prolonged the traffic stop. For example, when he asked the complainant to spell his name, he responded that the named officer should know how to spell it. Body- worn camera footage revealed that the complainant’s vehicle was parked in the roadway in a no parking red zone area when the officer contacted him, and it confirmed the named officer’s depiction of complainant and the progression of the traffic stop. The evidence proves that the alleged conduct occurred; however, the conduct was justified, lawful, and proper.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The complainant stated that as he was providing his information to the contact officer, the named officer rudely and without permission opened the front passenger door and removed the key from his car’s ignition while the car was running. The named officer stated that the complainant was confrontational and uncooperative during the initial contact with officers. The named officer stated that after the complainant initially refused to provide hi name, officers instructed him to lower his windows all the way so they could communicate with him. The complainant responded by turning on his car and completely rolling up his car’s tinted windows. The named officer stated he opened the complainant's car door for officer safety, in order to give himself a clear view of the interior of the passenger compartment area and observe the complainant’s actions. He then seized the car keys from the ignition and placed them on top of the car to prevent the complainant from driving off during the traffic stop. The named officer stated he and other officers instructed the complainant to relax as they continued to explain to him that his car was parked in a red zone and that he lacked the required front vehicle plate on his car. Body-worn camera footage showed that the complainant was upset, argumentative, and uncooperative. A witness officer told the complainant to leave his window lowered so that officers could communicate with him, but the complainant rolled up his windows and left his car running in violation of the officers’ request. The footage also showed that the officer’s demeanor was calm and professional. The named officer explained to the complainant the reason for the detention and the vehicle code violations that he observed. The officer could have cited the complainant for these violations, but he decided not to do so. The evidence proves that the alleged conduct occurred; however, the conduct was justified, lawful, and proper.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: During the investigation, DPA found that the named officers failed to timely activate his body-worn camera, as required. Named Officer #1 stated he activated his body-worn camera in the elevator on his way to speak with the complainant. He admitted that he did not activate his camera enroute to the scene. Named Officer #2 stated that he did not activate his body-worn camera enroute to this call and said he activated it in the elevator. He did not remember why he did not activate it while enroute but once he realized it was not activated, he immediately activated it in the elevator on the way to meet the complainant. The officer did state that he met with the front desk worker of the Hostel when he first arrived on scene. Named Officer #3 stated he did not activate his body-worn camera enroute to the scene, but he did not believe the complainant would still be at the hostel when they arrived. He stated that after they spoke to the staff and learned that the complainant was still on the premises, he activated his body-worn camera. The named officers’ body-worn camera footage began in buffer mode on the elevator on their way to meet the complainant but did not capture the initial interaction with the hotel staff prior to contacting the complainant. Department Bulletin 20-175 clarified members shall ensure the entire event is captured during all mandated recording circumstances by beginning the recording while enroute and prior to approaching the person, vehicle, location. A preponderance of the evidence proves that the alleged conduct occurred and that the conduct violated Department policy or procedure. \\x0c                 SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY',\n",

CATEGORY OF CONDUCT: CUO FINDING: PC FINDINGS OF FACT: DPA investigated whether SFPD disclosed in their search warrant and arrest warrant that the suspect was a victim in an unrelated crime. The named officer stated that they mentioned the CODIS database match in the arrest warrant and search warrant they drafted. The named officer stated that they were unaware the DNA match at the time came from an incident where the suspect was the victim in a sexual assault incident. The DPA obtained copies of the forensic report, arrest warrant and search warrant in this case. The forensic report references a DNA match but doesn’t specify that the DNA came from a victim. The arrest warrant included a cut and paste of the forensic report. The search warrant disclosed in bold letters that the prior match came from an incident where the suspect was a victim. The evidence showed that the named officer was unaware of the original source of the DNA match when they wrote an arrest warrant. When they realized the source, they documented the information in their chronological of the investigation and disclosed it in their search warrant affidavit in bold letters. Therefore, Named Officer #1 did not misrepresent the truth in the arrest or search warrant. \\x0c                 SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY COMPLAINT DATE: 02/15/22              COMPLETION DATE: 01/23/23                  PAGE# 4 of 4 The evidence proves that the alleged conduct occurred; however, the conduct was justified, lawful, and proper.',\n",

CATEGORY OF CONDUCT: CUO FINDING: IC/S FINDINGS OF FACT: DPA’s investigation found that the named officer violated Department General Order 2.01(9) when he reached down, picked up the complainant’s hat that fell inside the drug store, and rudely tossed the hat out onto the sidewalk. The named officer acknowledged that he picked up the complainant’s hat and tossed it on the sidewalk. He stated that he did not think about handing the complainant her hat. He believed tossing the complainant’s hat on the sidewalk was reasonable and denied any misconduct in the incident. The named officer’s partner stated that he did not witness the named officer tossing the complainant’s hat on the sidewalk, but he was aware the hat was outside because the complainant picked it up from the ground and swung it at him. He stated that he believed there were better ways to return the complainant’ hat; however, he did not believe that the named officer’s behavior rose to the level of misconduct.

CATEGORY OF CONDUCT: UA FINDING: IC/S FINDINGS OF FACT: The named officer stated that he and his partner responded to a call that began as a burglary and was upgraded to a robbery. Another officer responded as backup. The named officer was the primary investigating officer and had limited interaction with the male detainee. However, he directed the backup officer to pat search the detainee. The named officer based this decision solely on the nature of the call and had no recollection of whether he believed the detainee was armed and dangerous. Department General Order 5.03 established policies and procedures regarding investigative detentions. Members may conduct a pat search for weapons when the officer has specific and articulable fact causing them to believe the suspect is armed and dangerous. The validity of the pat search depends on the totality of the circumstances and turns on whether a reasonably prudent officer would be warranted in the belief that the officer’s safety, or that of others, was in danger. The investigation showed that the officer instructed the back-up officer to conduct a pat search and did not have specific and articulable facts causing him to believe the suspect was armed in dangerous. The investigation showed that the named primary investigating officer requested a pat search be conducted because of the nature of the call was for a robbery and a lot of times suspects have weapons on them. Thi justification, without more, was in direct violation of In re Jeremiah S. (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 299.

The named officer acknowledged that he was aware Traffic Administration would place a hold on the vehicle, and he did not write an incident report. He stated that the hold was automatic and that he confirmed the hold from the emergency operator he was in contact with at the time. He said that in similar ituations, he knew there was always a hold placed on the vehicle for Traffic Administration. The named officer said he had never written an incident report regarding a hold for Traffic Administration concerning expired registration and had never been trained to in this situation. DGO 9.06, Vehicle Tows, states in part: F. VEHICLE HOLDS. A vehicle \"hold\" may be placed on a towed vehicle under certain circumstances. A vehicle with a \"hold\" placed on it cannot be released until the \"hold\" has been removed by the appropriate investigative section. For example, a \"Hold for Robbery\" can only be removed by the Robbery Section. … 3. REPORTS. Whenever a hold is placed on a vehicle, an incident or accident report shall be completed explaining the reasons for the hold. The tow slip shows a hold was placed on the complainant’s vehicle for Traffic Administration. San Francisco Police Department’s DGO 9.06, Vehicle Tows, should be updated and is unclear on at least one key point. DGO 9.06(III)(F)(3) provides, “REPORTS. Whenever a hold is placed on a vehicle, an incident or accident report shall be completed explaining the reasons for the hold.” However, the DGO does not specify who is responsible for writing an incident report.

CATEGORY OF CONDUCT: ND FINDING: IC/S FINDINGS OF FACT: DPA’s investigation found that the named officer failed to document the search of Subject 1, the justification for the search and the presence of a car jack in the incident report, violating Department Bulletin 20-134. The named officer acknowledged that he wrote the incident report for this incident and that he failed to document the search of Subject 1, the justification for the search and the presence of a car jack on scene. The named officer did not know why he failed to document the search, and he stated that he did not document the presence of a car jack on scene because it was “not relevant” to the probable cause. The named officer stated that he documented that Subject 1 was not “in possession of burglary tools” because Subject 1 was not in possession of the car jack. Witness officers agreed that a car jack is a tool commonly used in the commission of catalytic converter thefts. A witness officer noted that the presence of the car jack was relevant information that he wished he had known about and which “points towards someone being engaged in catalytic converter theft.” Body-worn camera (“BWC”) footage showed that the named officer was present when the named officer’s partner searched Subject 1’s person during the incident. BWC footage showed that a witne officer and the named officer’s partner were aware that Subject 1 was manipulating the car jack with hi hands when officers first arrived on scene. Department Notice 20-134, Report Writing Responsibilities, specifically extolls the value of a thorough and comprehensive incident report. DN 20-134 points out that it harms officer credibility when “reasonable suspicion or probable cause are not articulated in narrative” and when officers fail to “articulate search and seizure consistent with Department policy and current laws.” Department Manual-11, SFPD Report Writing Manual, states that the narrative of a report must be complete, include information from witnesses and accurately describe any physical evidence.

Even if Subject 1’s possession of the car jack was not enough to establish probable cause to make an arrest, it was certainly evidence relevant to the crime the officers were investigating and hould have been included in the incident report.

The named supervisor stated that the witness officer told him that he wanted to run something by him and that a witness saw Subject 1 underneath the parked/damaged vehicle and heard cutting noises, but that Subject 1 did not have any tools. The witness officer told the named supervisor that there was not enough evidence to make an arrest. The named supervisor asked the witness officer if he needed him to respond to the scene, and the witness officer said no.

The named upervisor stated he was not aware until after the incident that witness officers did not take photos of Subject 1 or the parked/damaged vehicle, that witness officers did not take fingerprints from Subject 1 in the field, that witness officers did not secure the parked/damaged vehicle before leaving the scene, that witness officers did not search the parked/damaged vehicle for registration information, or that the witness officers did not collect the car jack as evidence.

He stated that other than telling the witness officer to articulate the lack of probable cause in the incident report, he did not give the witness officer any other advice or instructions regarding how to handle the incident. Body-worn camera (“BWC”) footage confirmed that one of the witness officers called the named officer during the incident, and that the witness officer failed to inform the named officer about the presence of a car jack and multiple witnesses during the conversation. BWC footage indicated that the witness officer told the named officer that there were “no tools.” BWC footage indicated that the witness officer told the named officer that there was not enough evidence to establish probable cause to arrest Subject 1 and that he wanted to do an investigative detention. BWC footage showed that the named officer approved of the named officer’s assessment. Department General Order 1.06, Duties of Superior Officers, states in the relevant part, “All superior officers shall guide and instruct subordinates in the performance of their duties and require strict compliance with the policies and procedures.” Although the named officer approved the witness officer’s decision not to arrest Subject 1, the witne officer failed to provide the named officer with all of the relevant information. The witness officer’ failure to communicate limited the named officer’s ability to assess the situation, provide appropriate guidance and bear the weight of responsibility for the witness officer’s decisions during this incident. Because the named officer was not on-scene, was told he was not needed on-scene, and was not informed of all of the relevant information, DPA cannot say by a preponderance of evidence that the named officer’s actions or lack thereof rose to the level of misconduct.

Body-worn camera (“BWC”) footage showed that after the named officer released Subject 1, he deactivated his BWC. Minutes later, a witness officer informed the named officer that the complainant and her roommate wanted to speak with the named officer about why Subject 1 was not arrested.

The named officer stated that he observed the complainant’s “unsteady gait” and speech patterns and made a determination that she and her companion were not “making sound judgment calls; that they were intoxicated past the point of being able to care for themselves and therefore . . . determined they needed to be placed on a timeout for 647(f).” The named officer described this as a “four-hour detention” that results in being “released at the end with no charges.” He explained that he reasoned that if “they were arguing with me, they’d argue with somebody else down the street; maybe get in a fight, maybe get combative, maybe break property, maybe hurt somebody down the street.” California Penal Code Section 647(f) states a person, “who is found in any public place under the influence of intoxicating liquor…in a condition that he or she is unable to exercise care for his or her own afety or the safety of others” has violated the code section.

The named officer explained how the complainant and her companion were under the influence of alcohol; however, he was not able to clearly articulate how the complainant satisfied the second element of being unable to care for herself. DPA interviewed a subject matter expert who explained that the training officers receive in Penal Code 647(f) is quite minimal (approximately 5-8 minutes during a 2-hour course, 2 pages of written materials) and does not include a review of case law. The expert further explained that officers are taught that a 647(f) is an opportunity to put an individual in a safe time-out and that determining whether an individual is unable to care for himself is a liability assessment. Given this, the officers acted in accordance with their training. However, because 647(f) requires more than just intoxication, the DPA believes that training should be updated to include a review of case law and analysis of the related nuances.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: During the investigation, DPA found that the named officer failed to activate hi body-worn camera footage while interacting with the complainant and the individual accused of hoplifting. The named officer acknowledged that while he was equipped with his body-worn camera, he did not activate it at any time during the incident. The named officer stated that it did not appear to him that the interactions, as explained above, required activation. The named officer explained that tempers were high, various things were being thrown at him at different times, and that he was simply trying to figure out what occurred with a “potential” shoplifter, if anything. He had not determined a crime had been committed, and therefore, did not activate his camera. He further explained that he did not perceive the ituation to be “hostile,” as enumerated in Department General Order (DGO) 10.11, Body-Worn Cameras. Rather, he perceived the situation to involve an elderly male who was loud, and rude, and portrayed behaviors consistent with undergoing a mental health episode, but not hostile. The surveillance footage showed that the named officer spoke with both the complainant and the individual accused of shoplifting. The footage also showed the named officer follow the individual to the checkout line where it appeared they continued their conversation. Department General Order 10.11, Section III C states, in part, “All on-scene members equipped with a BWC shall activate their BWC equipment to record in the following circumstances: . . . 2. Consensual encounters where the member suspects that the citizen may have knowledge of criminal activity as a uspect, witness, or victim; . . . 11.

However, there was also confusion about the mask mandate as the city had dropped the mask mandate for the month preceding the incident. The BWC showed the named officer was not wearing a mask. It showed the named officer was outdoor during the incident. San Francisco Department of Human Resources guidance had previously lifted the city’s mask mandate for approximately one month before this incident.

Named Officer #1 stated that he was the officer in charge on scene during the incident in question. Named Officer #1 stated that he responded to a local hospital after receiving a call from Named Officer #2 that the complainant wanted to file a complaint. Given the serious nature of the complaint and not wanting to cause a potential HIPAA violation, Named Officer #1 advised Named Officer #2 and Named Officer #3 to activate their cameras and to place them in their pockets just to obtain the audio of the conversation. Named Officer #1 stated that he just wanted Named Officer #2 and Named Officer #3 to use their body- worn cameras as audio recorders. Named Officer #1 stated that the complainant gave consent to record him and asked him to do so. The DPA obtained the named officer’s and two witness officers’ body-worn camera footage of the incident. The body-worn camera footage is consistent with the statement he provided in his DPA interview. Named Officer #2 and Named Officer #3 confirmed that the named officer gave them an order to activate their body-worn cameras inside of the hospital and place them into their pockets. They both confirmed that Named Officer #1 advised the complainant that he was being recorded and he consented to the recording. The DPA spoke with a Subject Matter Expert from the department regarding the body-worn cameras. The Subject Matter Expert stated that officers are not trained on using their body-worn cameras as audio recorders. The Subject Matter Expert also stated that the removing of a body-worn camera and placed in a pocket is not consistent with department policy, but it is also not prohibited. The Subject Matter Expert tated that are exceptions for recording inside of a hospital such as to obtain a statement but that they hould not be recording someone’s personal medical information.

The named officer stated that she was not aware of any Department policy on using or issuing spit masks. The officer stated that she was trained to use spit masks in previous employment outside the Department. She stated she had a spit mask on her utility belt, which she had obtained from paramedics at an earlier date. The officer said she used the spit mask as the detained person was spitting blood at other officer and members of the public. She said she did not believe it was forbidden for spit masks to be used. Body-camera footage showed the named officer placing a spit mask on the complainant, who can be seen and heard spitting. The Department Legal office confirmed no policy governing the training, use, or issuance of spit mask exists. As there is no policy covering spit masks, the named officer's use of a spit mask was neither in nor out of policy. However, DPA recommends that policy and training be created to guide officers in the use of spit masks.

He believed that turning the body-worn from the off to on position required more time than usual to acquire activation.

Based on the evidence received, the body-worn camera footage showed that the body-worn camera wa activated prior to approaching the complainant. The body-worn camera activation was made in accordance with Department policy with regard to self-initiated activity.

Department General Order 1.04 stated that all sergeants shall require all assigned members to comply with the policies and procedures of the Department, and take appropriate action when violations occur. The named officer acknowledged seeing the arresting officer use her knee to restrain the individual on the ground. He stated he saw the knee on the upper back and head but not on the individual’s neck. He further stated that the knee was in place for seconds only. The named officer confirmed that the knee on the back was a technique taught in the SFPD Academy and the knee on the head was not. He stated that it would be dangerous to have a knee on someone’s neck, but not on someone’s head. The named officer tated that he did not advise the arresting officer to remove her knee from the head and neck area of the individual because he did not think she had her knee on his neck a dangerous amount of time. Body worn camera footage showed the named officer verbally and physically assisting with the arrest and handcuffing of the individual. After the completion of the handcuffing, the named officer stood up, walked toward the head of the individual, and leaned down toward the officer that had her knee on the head and neck area of the individual. The officer moved her knee to the mid-back area of the individual and the named officer asked the individual if he was injured or had a complaint of pain. The individual laughed and lifted his head to look at bystanders. A preponderance of the evidence proves that the alleged conduct occurred and that the conduct violated Department policy or procedure.',\n",

CATEGORY OF CONDUCT:                    ND         FINDING:          IC/S       DEPT. ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: During the investigation, the DPA found that the named officer failed to activate his body-worn camera as required. Department Bulletin 20-175, which was issued to clarify when officers are required to activate their body- worn cameras, states, in pertinent part, “…when responding to calls for service or any of the mandatory recording circumstances, members shall begin recording by pressing the Event button while enroute and prior to arriving on scene.” The named officer stated that he understood and generally complied with both DGO 10.11 and DB 20- 175. However, he acknowledged that he did not activate his body worn camera while in enroute to the incident or at the time of his arrival. He stated that the call for service type changed from a fight with no weapons to a civil standby; however, this was not documented anywhere in Department Records. Police and DEM records indicated that the named officer was dispatched and responded to a call for ervice. Records also confirmed that there was no body-worn camera footage for this incident. Both Department General Order 10.11 and Department Bulletin 20-175 do not require proof of criminal activity for body-worn camera activation. In fact, DB 20-175 requires activation when officers are en route to a call for service and DGO 10.11 mandates that all on-scene members equipped with a BWC to activate their BWC equipment to record detentions and arrests, consensual encounters, and where the member suspects that the citizen may have knowledge of criminal activity as a suspect, witness, or victim.

The named officer stated that she had her facemask on when she spoke to the complainant. She stated she lowered her mask after the complainant stated he could not understand the named officer. The BWC showed the named officer had a facemask on when she spoke to the complainant. The BWC howed the named officer lowered her mask when the complainant told her he could not hear her. Department Bulletin 20-094 was in place during the incident. It states, in relevant parts:        “Although the Department of Human resources (DHR) is recommending the use of simple barrier        isolation masks during the entire shift for all Department members, in order to stay ahead of the        curve, a mask or respirator must now be worn at all times in the workplace and in the community        as we engage with each other or while providing service to the community.” The evidence showed the named officer did not violate the Department Bulletin as it is stated.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: During the investigation of a failure to make an arrest complaint, the DPA discovered that the named officers received an order to release the complainant’s roommate for lack of probable cause to arrest. The named officer stated that there was a lack of probable cause to arrest for vandalism (Penal Code ection 594(b)) based on the inconsistent statements from the involved parties and the lack of independent evidence. The named officer recalled being briefed on the incident and contacting the patrol officers to discuss it further. The named officer recalled telling the patrol officer that probable cause to arrest wa thin based on the conflicting statements from the parties, lack of evidence, and he believed that alcohol had been a factor. The named officer stated he was aware that his orders to release the person in custody conflicted with the previous orders to arrest, but instructed the patrol officers to release the complainant’ roommate with the understanding that the incident would be investigated further by the Station Investigation Team (SIT). The named officer stated he was not aware of the complainant’s video evidence. However, he stated his decision to release the complainant’s roommate for lack of probable cause for vandalism was not affected after reviewing the body-worn camera footage nor the complainant’ video evidence.

Department General Order 1.04 states that supervisors shall, “train and lead subordinates in the performance of their duties and set an example of efficiency and deportment.” In this case, action of the named officer deciding to release the detained person from custody, in conflict with the previous order provided to the patrol officers after the investigation had been concluded and the probable cause to arrest had been determined, was not consistent with the Department policy. The officers on scene did a painstaking investigation, they consulted with two superior officers who asked appropriate questions, had multiple calls with the officers as they gathered more evidence, researched the Penal Code, and ordered the officers to arrest the complainant’s roommate. All involved parties had been briefed on what was going to happen next. Sergeant #1 was clear that although Sergeant #3 would have to review and sign off on the incident report, he had already approved the charges, meaning that Sergeant #3 would not have to sign off on the booking. Yet Sergeant #3 intervened to overrule the two previou ergeants, who knew more about the facts and had researched the law. For subordinate officers, clarity and continuity is of paramount importance when making decisions in the field. Due to the lack of clarity here, the subordinate officers were left with conflicting orders, confusion, and frustration. When it is clear that a previous superior officer made a glaring mistake or significant new evidence is uncovered after that person’s shift is over, a change in position may be reasonable and even required. But it is not reasonable or necessary to completely change the trajectory of an investigation olely because of a difference of opinion, given the detrimental effect it has on the subordinate officer who have been dealing with that situation firsthand for hours. Here, it left the complainant highly upset, causing unnecessary frustration and confusion for both the people on scene and the officers. Based on the totality of the evidence obtained, there was probable cause to arrest for a violation of Penal Code section 594(b). A preponderance of the evidence proves that the alleged conduct occurred and that the conduct violated Department policy or procedure.',\n",

The named officer reviewed the body-worn camera footage, spoke with the witness officer, reviewed the incident report, and approved the Supervisory Use of Force Evaluation that stated that the subordinate officer’s use of force was within policy, even though it appeared that the use of force was out of policy and should have been reported and dealt with as such.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: DPA discovered during its investigation that the named officer did not activate his body-worn camera (BWC) as required by Department General Order 10.11. The named officer stated he did not activate his BWC because the call for service did not meet the criteria of mandatory activation under Department General Order 10.11. He stated he did not feel that the encounter was hostile. He also stated BWC was in buffering mode and was prepared to activate it if the incident had become one that would have met the listed criteria in DGO 10.11.

BWC footage of the named officer’s partners captured the named officer interacting with a hostile woman who refused to leave the area where the Department was helping Public Works clear. Department General Order 10.11 states in the relevant part that officers shall activate their BWCs “during an encounter with a member of the public that becomes hostile.” Although the named officer was not required to activate his BWC when he was initially called to assist another city agency, he was required to activate it under DGO 10.11 when he encountered the woman who became hostile.

Probable cause supported complainant’s arrest and citation for a violation of 148 (a)(1) (PC), which made a search incident to arrest of complainant lawful.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: As mentioned above, while independent grounds existed to tow the complainant’s vehicle, evidence supports that the named officer made the decision to tow the vehicle in retaliation in violation of Department General Order 9.01 and 2.01. Department General Order 9.01 Section I. (A)(3), states: “DISCRETION: Members enforcing traffic and parking laws must also use discretion; however, members shall not let the attitude of the violator influence their enforcement action.” Department General Order 2.01, Section 1. 9 prohibits conduct that reflects discredit upon the Department or any member or is prejudicial to the efficiency and discipline of the Department. Body worn camera footage reveals that the named officer repeatedly discussed with several officers that he felt compelled to cite complainant and tow his vehicle because complainant was “difficult” and would likely file a complaint of misconduct against her. While the named officer adamantly denied that complainant’s behavior influenced her decision-making process, the conversations observed on the body- worn camera bely her denials. One of the sergeants at the scene attempted to reason with the named officer and encourage her to advise the complainant rather than tow his vehicle. The named officer responded: “Okay, but I am still going forth with the 148, if he wants to go and complain, and do all of this, and we just advise him, then what was the point of stopping him . . .

I am not advising on the 148, only the tow.” Moreover, throughout the incident the named officer made additional comments, such as: “This is going to be a complaint, 100 percent . . . when it comes down the line they are going to say, well why did you top them if you were just going to advise.” The named officer also made numerous comments about how “difficult” the complainant was. The named officer characterized such comments as “bouncing ideas off her partners, wanting to ensure, given the current atmosphere, “she did everything in the correct manner,” and doing things by the “letter of the law.” Finally, in a conversation with her partner, body-worn camera footage captured the named officer lowering her voice and stating, “I mean… if this were different, I was not going to tow it.” The partner DATE OF COMPLAINT: 11/25/19                DATE OF COMPLETION: 02/22/21               PAGE# 6 of 7 responds: “No, of course not! Roll down your window, give us your paperwork, give us your ID, hey great, we will advise.” While the named officer had the right to exercise her discretion and tow the vehicle, such a decision cannot be influenced by the behavior of the detainee or the officer’s fear that a complaint may be lodged against her. Body-worn camera footage shows that her decisions to take certain enforcement actions were improperly influenced by the possibility that complainant would file a complaint against her. By considering these issues when making enforcement decisions, the named officer engaged in retaliatory behavior because she allowed the attitude and behavior of the violator to influence her decisions in violation of DGO 9.01 and 2.01. A preponderance of the evidence proves that the alleged conduct occurred and that the conduct violated Department policy or procedure.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: At the complainant’s request, his girlfriend arrived at the scene. The named officer described the girlfriend as extremely cooperative. The girlfriend wanted to retrieve her purse from the vehicle. The named officer confirmed that she intended on giving the purse back to the girlfriend and would not have towed the vehicle with the purse in it. However, prior to giving the purse back, the named officer searched the purse. The named officer justified her search of the purse as an inventory search of the vehicle and a search for officer safety. She explained that she was allowed to search “containers” in vehicles to be towed pursuant to DGO 9.06, and she did not want to return the purse before confirming that it did not contain any weapons. While DGO 9.06 authorizes a broad and comprehensive inventory search of a vehicle to be towed, it doe not allow the officer to give items in the vehicle to bystanders after searching them. Inventory searche are designed to protect an owner's property while it is in the custody of the police, and they must be conducted under standardized police department procedures, and they cannot be used as a pretext to earch for weapons or contraband. Moreover, DGO 9.06 specifies a procedure to use when handling item of value, and requires the officers report the inventory search in their incident report and produce an itemized list of the contents of the vehicle on a prescribed form. The purse did not appear on the inventory form and it was not noted in the incident report. Here, the girlfriend was neither detained nor in the vehicle at the time of the stop, and the officer intended from the beginning to give the purse to the girlfriend. Its search cannot be justified as an inventory search because it was not going into police custody for safekeeping. Whether the named officer searched the purse pursuant to an inventory search, or for officer safety, the search was unwarranted and violated the Fourth Amendment. A preponderance of the evidence proves that the alleged conduct occurred and that the conduct violated Department policy or procedure.\",\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The complainant stated he went to the police station to report that his roommate threatened to kill him. He stated he waited five hours to meet with officers. The complainant stated he eventually met with the named officers and reported the threat, but the named officers did not investigate the allegation and told him to go home. An incident report was not prepared by either named officer. Department records indicate that the complainant walked into a police station and reported that hi roommate slapped him, took his phone, and threatened to kill him. Named officer #1 stated she could not recall the incident, but she likely did not write an incident report because nothing criminal occurred. She stated that she most likely reviewed the records indicating that the complainant’s roommate had slapped him and threatened to kill him prior to meeting with the complainant. She stated that she did not recall what the complainant reported to her because it was most likely something very standard that required no police action. Named officer #2 stated he recalled the complainant conveying he had been slapped by his roommate, but he did not author a written report because the complainant never requested a police report, and only wanted a ride home and a civil standby. Named officer #2 stated he reviewed the records that documented the threats and harassment prior to meeting with the complainant. Named officer #2 stated he did not write an incident report because the complainant did not tell him anything that met the elements of criminal threats. Both named officers stated that stated that if the complainant had reported to them that his roommate threatened to kill him, they would have investigated the allegation and likely written a report. The named officers stated that the complainant requested a ride home so they could assist in resolving a civil issue with his roommate. The officers were unable to do so because of COVID-19 and the inability to social distance in the patrol vehicle. The officers stated that they told the complainant to go home and call the police if further police action was required, but the complainant never called the police after he left the tation. The officers stated they would have helped the complainant if he had called the police once he returned home.

It also indicates that the complainant met with the named officers over five hours after he made his report. The Department was unable to produce any body-worn camera footage for this incident. Department General Order 2.01 states in pertinent part that officers “shall perform their duties promptly and according to Department policies and procedures.” It also states that officers “shall maintain a working knowledge of all information required for the proper performance of their duties . . .” In addition, officers “shall obey all lawful written orders, policies and procedures of the Department . . .” Department General 1.03 state, Patrol Officers shall: “Make written reports on crimes observed or brought to their attention that have not been previously reported.” Department Bulletin 18-154 (Report Writing Responsibilities Supervisors, Officers and Police Service Aids) states in relevant part that preparing factual and thorough incident reports is one of the most important duties of a police officer. SFPD Report Writing Manual states in relevant part that incident reports are among the most important documents used within the Criminal Justice System and that they provide and accurate and objective account of an incident. Given the totality of the circumstances, namely, the initial report of a crime, the complainant’s willingne to wait for officer for five hours, and his reluctance to go home, a written report was required. Additionally, Named Officer #2 recalled the complainant describing that he was the victim of a criminal act, a slap, at the hands of his roommate, further substantiating that a written report was required under the circumstances. A preponderance of the evidence proves that the alleged conduct occurred and that the conduct violated Department policy or procedure.

They opined it may have been deleted because they may have labeled the footage as having no evidentiary value.

The named officers were dispatched to meet with the complainant, who reported that his roommate had threatened to kill him and took his phone. DGO 10.11 and Department Bulletin 18-256 required them to activate their BWC. It does not appear that the officers turned on their BWC.

Named officer #2 stated he did not activate his BWC en route to the complainant’s residence because he was already at the location on another call for service. In addition, he stated he did not activate his BWC when he made initial contact with any party because he was not sure that complainant was seeking law enforcement action when the complainant first approached the officers.

CATEGORY OF CONDUCT:                    ND        FINDING:          TF      DEPT. ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: DPA brought a DPA-Added Allegation for failure to write an incident report a required under Department Notice 20-045. Department Notice 20-045 Enforcement of Public Health Orders states, in part: “Members may observe or receive reports about other conduct…that appears to violate the SIP Order, such as: a non- Essential Business is operating; any business is failing to practice Social Distancing; or other potential violations. Members may conduct a preliminary investigation of such conduct, and educate individual about the requirements of the SIP Order. Members should not take enforcement action. Members shall document the contact into the incident report.” The named member acknowledged she did not write an incident report because her understanding of the Department Notice was that officers had the discretion to write a report based on whether there wa compliance by the business and if enforcement action was necessary. The officer further stated she understood that if a non-essential business continued to defy the Order, she was directed to discuss the violation, produce a report upon non-compliance, and then if the non-compliance continued, issue the citation. She stated that when she spoke to the employee, she felt the business would comply with the Health Order. The Department Notice was prepared during a chaotic time, in response to an impending public health emergency. The definitions of “Essential Businesses” were fluid, which created confusion for members. The use of the terms “should” and “shall” in the Notice created an ambiguity that made it difficult for officers to ascertain when an incident report needed to be written and when it did not. The Department failed to provide proper training to officers when the Notice was issued as to the requirements of writing an incident report. Three days after the incident, the Department issued an updated Notice that superseded Department Notice 20-064. The evidence proves that the alleged conduct resulted from inadequate or inappropriate training.',\n",

CATEGORY OF CONDUCT:                   PP        FINDING:          PF        DEPT. ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The DPA received a complaint about plainclothes officers in the Violent Crime Reduction Unit using excessive force and choking a person during an arrest. The officers were patrolling to abate community concerns about gun violence when the arrest occurred. Although the officers were wearing plainclothes and riding in an unmarked car, the operation was not covert and all four officers in the unit had stars visible on their outermost garments. One officer explained that they were driving around at night “showing [police] presence” as a deterrent for violent crime. He stated that their unmarked car was “easily identifiable as a police vehicle” because it was a black sport utility vehicle that was equipped with emergency lights, a siren, and spotlights. The use-of-force incident occurred when the officers attempted to detain three individuals who were uspected of having firearms. To initiate the detention, the officers shone spotlights and flashlights onto the individuals, got out of their car, and announced themselves as police officers. The individuals ran and officers chased and caught two of them. One individual stated that officers roughed him up unnecessarily and choked him during the arrest. The officers acknowledged using force but denied choking the arrestee, who they said pulled an automatic rifle from his waistband and threw it into the street while struggling with the officers. The officers described tackling the arrestee to the ground and using their arms and fist to deliver distraction blows to the arrestee’s head and back. They stated that the force they used wa reasonable and necessary because the arrestee was attempting to escape, and they believed he was trying to signal his friend to find the firearm he threw and use it against the officers. Under Department policy, the involved officers were exempt from wearing body-worn cameras because they were working a plainclothes assignment. Surveillance video was inconclusive as to the type and level of force used due to the angle of the camera and low video resolution. The DPA was unable to make definitive findings in its use-of-force investigation for lack of sufficient evidence.',\n",
       "       'SUMMARY OF DPA-ADDED ALLEGATION #1: Continued. DATE OF COMPLAINT: 09/03/2020              DATE OF COMPLETION: 08/25/21                  PAGE# 4 of 4 The DPA finds that the Department should authorize and order plainclothes officers to wear body-worn cameras when taking enforcement action. The officers involved in the use-of-force incident were patrolling to abate gun violence by showing a police presence in a particular area. Their purpose was to detect and investigate crime in a non-covert capacity. They were wearing stars on their outermost garments and, when they decided to detain three individuals, they used spotlights and immediately announced themselves as officers. In this situation, wearing body-worn cameras would not have posed any logistical or safety risks and would have served a valuable evidentiary purpose by showing the individual discarding his firearm. Body-worn cameras are effective tools for gathering evidence and ensuring accountability. Department General Order 10.11, Body Worn Cameras, states that “Only members authorized by the Chief of Police and trained in the use of BWCs are allowed to wear Department-issued BWCs.” Additionally, officer working plainclothes assignments were specifically exempted from wearing body-worn cameras in 2018 under Department Bulletin 18-256. The DPA recommends that the Chief of Police authorize plainclothe units to wear body-worn cameras and order that the cameras be activated when plainclothes officer engage in non-covert police action. The DPA acknowledges that policy changes are forthcoming and reiterates the importance of body-worn cameras, given that the lack of footage in this case rendered the DPA unable to make findings by a preponderance of the evidence. The DPA recommends that SFPD policy or procedure be changed or modified.',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: During the investigation, DPA found that the named officer failed to activate her body-worn camera from the very beginning of the contact with the complainant. Department record howed that the named officer documented in her incident report that she initially did not activate her body-worn camera due to the quick escalation of the incident and with concern for officer safety. The named officer stated that the incident quickly escalated from a consensual encounter to taking law enforcement action and that she did not activate her body-worn camera until the incident became a detention and she felt safe. Store surveillance video revealed a very brief contact between the complainant and the officer before the complainant tried to push his way past the officer to reenter the store. Within moments, the complainant wung his hand across the officer’s face, causing injury. Department General Order 10.11 requires members equipped with body-worn cameras to activate them to record detention and arrests. Furthermore, Department Bulletin 20-175 clarified that members shall ensure the entire event is captured during all mandated recording circumstances by beginning the recording prior to approaching a person, vehicle, or location. Department rules require an officer to activate a body-worn camera before approaching a situation where enforcement action is likely. However, in this case, the named officer was working an overtime shift at a retail store, which meant she was frequently interacting with store staff and guests in a consensual manner. When she initially approached the complainant and store staff, her intent was to calm the ituation and find out if anyone needed help. This initial brief contact by the named officer with the complainant began a consensual encounter that quickly escalated into a detention with handcuffing. When the encounter escalated, the named officer activated her camera as soon as possible and quickly enough to record the detention, handcuffing, and release of the complainant from the scene. The officer adhered to the required Department regulation when an incident occurred requiring that she activate her BWC. The regulation allows for officers to activate their cameras when safe. The officer properly indicated in her incident report when and why she activated her camera.

The officers’ body-worn camera recordings are roughly twenty minutes long. Approximately six minute into the recordings, the officers muted their body-worn cameras and never unmuted them up to the time they deactivated or stopped recording.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: As mentioned above, while independent grounds existed to tow the complainant’s vehicle, evidence supports that the named officer made the decision to tow the vehicle in retaliation in violation of Department General Order 9.01 and 2.01. Department General Order 9.01 Section I. (A)(3), states: “DISCRETION: Members enforcing traffic and parking laws must also use discretion; however, members shall not let the attitude of the violator influence their enforcement action.” Department General Order 2.01, Section 1. 9 prohibits conduct that reflects discredit upon the Department or any member or is prejudicial to the efficiency and discipline of the Department. Body worn camera footage reveals that the named officer repeatedly discussed with several officers that he felt compelled to cite complainant and tow his vehicle because complainant was “difficult” and would likely file a complaint of misconduct against her. While the named officer adamantly denied that complainant’s behavior influenced her decision-making process, the conversations observed on the body- worn camera bely her denials. One of the sergeants at the scene attempted to reason with the named officer and encourage her to advise the complainant rather than tow his vehicle. The named officer responded: “Okay, but I am still going forth with the 148, if he wants to go and complain, and do all of this, and we just advise him, then what was the point of stopping him . . . I will do an expired reg, advise on the tow, but doing the 148, he made it a lot more difficult, if he wants to go and make a complaint about me, all this and that, and we do nothing about it? I am not advising on the 148, only the tow.” Moreover, throughout the incident the named officer made additional comments, such as: “This is going to be a complaint, 100 percent . . . when it comes down the line they are going to say, well why did you top them if you were just going to advise.” The named officer also made numerous comments about how “difficult” the complainant was. The named officer characterized such comments as “bouncing ideas off her partners, wanting to ensure, given the current atmosphere, “she did everything in the correct manner,” and doing things by the “letter of the law.” Finally, in a conversation with her partner, body-worn camera footage captured the named officer lowering her voice and stating, “I mean… if this were different, I was not going to tow it.” The partner DATE OF COMPLAINT: 11/25/19                DATE OF COMPLETION: 02/22/21               PAGE# 6 of 7 responds: “No, of course not! Roll down your window, give us your paperwork, give us your ID, hey great, we will advise.” While the named officer had the right to exercise her discretion and tow the vehicle, such a decision cannot be influenced by the behavior of the detainee or the officer’s fear that a complaint may be lodged against her. Body-worn camera footage shows that her decisions to take certain enforcement actions were improperly influenced by the possibility that complainant would file a complaint against her. By considering these issues when making enforcement decisions, the named officer engaged in retaliatory behavior because she allowed the attitude and behavior of the violator to influence her decisions in violation of DGO 9.01 and 2.01. A preponderance of the evidence proves that the alleged conduct occurred and that the conduct violated Department policy or procedure.

While DGO 9.06 authorizes a broad and comprehensive inventory search of a vehicle to be towed, it doe not allow the officer to give items in the vehicle to bystanders after searching them. Inventory searche are designed to protect an owner's property while it is in the custody of the police, and they must be conducted under standardized police department procedures, and they cannot be used as a pretext to earch for weapons or contraband.

Named officer #1 stated she could not recall the incident, but she likely did not write an incident report because nothing criminal occurred. She stated that she most likely reviewed the records indicating that the complainant’s roommate had slapped him and threatened to kill him prior to meeting with the complainant. She stated that she did not recall what the complainant reported to her because it was most likely something very standard that required no police action. Named officer #2 stated he recalled the complainant conveying he had been slapped by his roommate, but he did not author a written report because the complainant never requested a police report, and only wanted a ride home and a civil standby. Named officer #2 stated he reviewed the records that documented the threats and harassment prior to meeting with the complainant. Named officer #2 stated he did not write an incident report because the complainant did not tell him anything that met the elements of criminal threats. Both named officers stated that stated that if the complainant had reported to them that his roommate threatened to kill him, they would have investigated the allegation and likely written a report. The named officers stated that the complainant requested a ride home so they could assist in resolving a civil issue with his roommate. The officers were unable to do so because of COVID-19 and the inability to social distance in the patrol vehicle. The officers stated that they told the complainant to go home and call the police if further police action was required, but the complainant never called the police after he left the tation. The officers stated they would have helped the complainant if he had called the police once he returned home.

Department General Order 2.01 states in pertinent part that officers “shall perform their duties promptly and according to Department policies and procedures.” It also states that officers “shall maintain a working knowledge of all information required for the proper performance of their duties . . .” In addition, officers “shall obey all lawful written orders, policies and procedures of the Department . . .” Department General 1.03 state, Patrol Officers shall: “Make written reports on crimes observed or brought to their attention that have not been previously reported.” Department Bulletin 18-154 (Report Writing Responsibilities Supervisors, Officers and Police Service Aids) states in relevant part that preparing factual and thorough incident reports is one of the most important duties of a police officer. SFPD Report Writing Manual states in relevant part that incident reports are among the most important documents used within the Criminal Justice System and that they provide and accurate and objective account of an incident. Given the totality of the circumstances, namely, the initial report of a crime, the complainant’s willingne to wait for officer for five hours, and his reluctance to go home, a written report was required. Additionally, Named Officer #2 recalled the complainant describing that he was the victim of a criminal act, a slap, at the hands of his roommate, further substantiating that a written report was required under the circumstances. A preponderance of the evidence proves that the alleged conduct occurred and that the conduct violated Department policy or procedure.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: DPA brought a DPA-Added Allegation for failure to write an incident report a required under Department Notice 20-045. Department Notice 20-045 Enforcement of Public Health Orders states, in part: “Members may observe or receive reports about other conduct…that appears to violate the SIP Order, such as: a non- Essential Business is operating; any business is failing to practice Social Distancing; or other potential violations. Members may conduct a preliminary investigation of such conduct, and educate individual about the requirements of the SIP Order. Members should not take enforcement action. Members shall document the contact into the incident report.” The named member acknowledged she did not write an incident report because her understanding of the Department Notice was that officers had the discretion to write a report based on whether there wa compliance by the business and if enforcement action was necessary. The officer further stated she understood that if a non-essential business continued to defy the Order, she was directed to discuss the violation, produce a report upon non-compliance, and then if the non-compliance continued, issue the citation. She stated that when she spoke to the employee, she felt the business would comply with the Health Order. The Department Notice was prepared during a chaotic time, in response to an impending public health emergency. The definitions of “Essential Businesses” were fluid, which created confusion for members. The use of the terms “should” and “shall” in the Notice created an ambiguity that made it difficult for officers to ascertain when an incident report needed to be written and when it did not. The Department failed to provide proper training to officers when the Notice was issued as to the requirements of writing an incident report. Three days after the incident, the Department issued an updated Notice that superseded Department Notice 20-064.

The named officer stated she did not activate her body-worn camera (BWC) while en route because she was at the complainant’s residence within one minute, and her main concern was the safety of the complainant. She stated in an interview that she did not recall why she did not activate her BWC while en route. She stated she did not remember whether she double-tapped the camera or not, but when she realized that she did not, she double-tapped it. She further explained that there was no buffering mode because the BWC was not on. The named officer indicated she did not understand that if double-tap, the BWC means pressing the “Event” button. Additionally, she did not understand BWC buffering mode. Body-worn camera footage shows that there was no buffering mode at the beginning of the footage. In addition, the BWC starts recording after the officer entered the complainant’s residence. The officer did not start the recording while en route.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: Department records show that the officers responded to a well-being check requested by the complainant’s brother. He informed dispatch that the complainant had a history of drug use and was standing in the middle of the street, high on PCP, refusing to move. The named officers were first on scene and knew the information relayed to dispatch by complainant’ brother. When they arrived on scene, they saw complainant standing in the middle of the street, but they were able to convince him to move to the sidewalk. Named officer #1 explained their presence to the complainant and asked him questions to determine if he was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and event. The complainant initially answered the officer’s the questions appropriately but became increasing irritated as the questioning continued. The complainant began to inquire repeatedly why the officers were present. After a while, the complainant began sarcastically repeating the officer’s questions back to him. Named officer #1 stated that the complainant appeared agitated, and described his speech as delayed, clipped, aggressive, and laden with profanity. Named officer #1 stated his goal was to get medical care for the complainant, keep him calm, and avoid a physical altercation since he had no reason to believe criminal activity was afoot. Paramedics arrived and evaluated complainant. The complainant exhibits the same behavior during hi interaction with the paramedics. For example, when the paramedics asked complainant evaluative questions such as, “How many quarters are in a dollar twenty-five,” the complainant responded “How many QUARTERS?! You’re [expletive] kidding me, right?” The paramedics concluded that complainant was alert and oriented enough to decline medical treatment and refused to transport him without the officers’ authorization of a WIC § 5150 hold. Named officer#1 spoke with the complainant’s family again. The complainant’s sister reiterated her displeasure about complainant’s continued presence in front of her home, but she and her brother acknowledged that they did not see complainant ingest PCP. The brother then informed the officer that prior to their arrival, the complainant “thought he was a car,” and the sister described the complainant a being “a danger to society.” Named officer #1 consulted with the sergeant on scene about authorizing a WIC § 5150 psychiatric hold. Body-worn camera footage reflects that during this conversation, named officer #1 informed the sergeant DATE OF COMPLAINT: 11/05/19               DATE OF COMPLETION: 11/19/20                 PAGE# 4 of 7 that medics declined to transport complainant without police intervention, and the sergeant was shocked. The decision was eventually made by the officers on scene to authorize a WIC § 5150 hold. Body-worn camera (BWC) footage shows that the officers concluded that complainant was under the influence of PCP without conducting any standardized field sobriety tests, without consulting a certified Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) officer, and without any proof that complainant had ingested drugs that day. The BWC depicts officers that seemed perplexed about how best to handle the situation. The officer told DPA they did not think they could request the assistance of a DRE because DRE officers only responded to cases involving DUI investigations. The officers also struggled to explain why they determined that complainant was a danger to himself, only citing that he it was nighttime, he was wearing dark clothing and was in a lane of traffic on a residential street at the time of their arrival. Department General Order 6.14, Psychological Evaluation of Adults states in relevant part:        A. CRITERIA FOR INVOLUNTARY DETENTIONS. Officers may detain an individual           for psychiatric evaluation pursuant to Section 5150 of the Welfare and Institution           Code only when the officer believes that, as a result of mental illness, an individual is:        1. A danger to himself/herself, or        2. A danger to others, or        3. Gravely disabled, meaning the individual is unable to care for himself/herself and ha           no reliable source of food, shelter, or clothing. Welfare & Institutions Code 5150 states, in relevant part, that a police officer may, upon probable cause, take a person into custody for a psychiatric evaluation when the person, as a result of a mental health disorder, is a danger to others, himself/herself, or gravely disabled. During the investigation, DPA determined there was no policy to inform officers how to properly and thoroughly evaluate an individual that may be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol if the individual is not driving. Officers have no guidance concerning how to determine whether a detainee’s level of intoxication is equivalent to a mental health disorder, which requires WIC 5150 detention because it is at the point where the individual has become gravely disabled or a danger to themselves or others. While the officers were aware that certain drugs, particularly hallucinogens such as PCP, can cause symptom which mimic acute psychosis, they did not have the tools to properly investigate their suspicions about complainant’s intoxication, and they did not have guidance on how to determine whether the complainant’s level of intoxication had reached a point where it was equivalent to a mental health disorder, acute enough to warrant involuntary hospitalization. DATE OF COMPLAINT: 11/05/19                DATE OF COMPLETION: 11/19/20                 PAGE# 5 of 7 It is commendable that SFPD is finding alternatives to incarcerating intoxicated individuals. DPA agree that having intoxicated individuals receive medical treatment rather than incarceration is a favorable outcome. The DPA also acknowledges that identifying and differentiating between symptoms attributable mental illness or drug intoxication or both can be a daunting task, especially when the analysis must also include a determination about whether the individual is, thus, gravely disabled, or a danger to themselve or others. However, SFPD can create policy and training to offer officers more guidance on how to evaluate these circumstances and give them the option of requesting a DRE officer respond to the scene to aid in evaluation. A DRE officer is better equipped to conduct a more thorough, objective, and accurate analysis of a person suspected of being under the influence of psychosis-inducing drugs, and whether the intoxication is likely to lead to self-harm, harm of others or grave disability. SFPD can also provide officers with guidance and more clarity about how to recognize and identify symptoms that show that an individual is likely to be gravely disabled or a danger to themselves or others when under the influence of drugs rather than as a result of a mental illness and how to deal with them short of incarceration. The DRE curriculum notes that the use of DRE officers is an effective means of identifying drug-impaired individuals. Drug recognition evaluations in police work have gained acceptance and approval primarily due to their thoroughness and effectiveness. Currently, DRE-trained SFPD officers only respond to DUI and traffic related cases. Having a DRE officer available to respond to other incidents, such as this one, will assist officers in making more sound, evidence-based decision concerning WIC § 5150 detentions. This in turn, will also free up crowded psychiatric wards of inappropriate and unwarranted psychiatric evaluations. The allegations here of failure to properly investigate are the result of Policy/Training Failures. DPA recommends that the training, policy, and or procedures be changed and modified in accordance with above.',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: As mentioned above, the officers placed the complainant on an involuntary psychiatric hold pursuant to DGO 6.14 and WIC § 5150. The named officer served as the admitting officer and completed the mental health form. The named officer stated he had probable cause for taking the complainant into psychiatric detention based on his discussions with other officers on scene, his discussions with complainant’s family, direction from his sergeant, and his observations of complainant. The named officer pointed out that the complainant’s family told officers complainant was dangerous and attempting to fight any person who tried to assist him. The named officer also elaborated that the complainant was wearing black clothing and standing in the middle of the street at night, posing an additional danger to himself and others. The named officer also believed the complainant was under the influence of PCP. He said he based thi determination on the family’s statements mentioned previously, and his observations that complainant was agitation, aggressive, slow to react, and asked the same questions repeatedly, and his training and experience that these can be symptoms of PCP ingestion. He also pointed out that PCP intoxication can mimic acute psychosis, impair one’s ability to care for oneself, and can possibly cause a person to be a danger to others. Acute psychosis can serve as a basis for detention pursuant to WIC § 5150 and DGO 6.14. For the reasons stated above, DPA recommends that the department adopt better policies and train officer to use evidence-based analytical tools to determine whether a person is intoxicated, whether the intoxication is due to drugs likely to cause symptoms that mirror mental illness symptoms that can result in grave disability and dangerousness to self or others, and provide officers with options to deal with such ituations. As stated above, DPA recommends, among other things, expanding the use of DRE-certified officers. The allegation of detention without justification is the result of Policy/Training Failures.

All officers acknowledged that they were on scene during the detention. One of the named officers, a ergeant, stated she was acting as a Field Training Officer. She said she was on scene as back-up and to evaluate the lead officer’s performance. She stated that because she was not actively participating in the investigation, she did not activate her BWC immediately upon arrival on scene. The named officer stated he deactivated her BWC once she felt the investigation was complete, although her recruit was still peaking with the complainant. She stated she did not have any contact with any involved parties or witnesses; however, she spoke with a neighbor in the area regarding the cars involved. The second named officer stated that he was a back-up officer. He said he assisted the lead officer in obtaining surveillance video from a nearby store. The named officer admitted that he turned his camera off while in the store and did not re-activate because he thought his role in the investigation was over. He acknowledged that after deactivating he discussed the video with the complainant and other officers. The third named officer stated that he did not activate his BWC when he first arrived because he was a back-up officer. He stated he activated it when he briefly spoke with the complainant and his friend. BWC recordings show that the named officers did not have their cameras activated throughout the entire investigation and their time on-scene. One of the named officers’ recording shows that he deactivated hi camera while reviewing surveillance video, then did not reactivate later when discussing the video with the complainant and other officers. Other BWC recordings show that the two other named officers did not activate their BWC’s upon arrival at the scene. Department of Emergency Management records show the named officers were responding to a call that was labeled as “Person with Gun”.

The named officer said he delivered several hammer fist strikes to the subject’s head. He acknowledged that he was gripping handcuffs, held by their chain, in the same hand at the time. When asked if he was utilizing his handcuffs as an impact weapon, either intentionally or unintentionally, the named officer stated, “I mean, if you want to say unintentionally, but at that point, it’s just the tool that I'm trying to use to arrest him, but as I'm delivering the fist strike, it’s possible it can be mistaken as an impact weapon.” The named officer stated he used force during this incident in order to affect an arrest.

However, whether intentional or unintentional, when the named officer began striking the subject in the back of hi head with handcuffs, those handcuffs became an impact weapon. The named officer acknowledged he used hammer fist strikes. A hammer fist strike occurs when an officer strikes a suspect with the bottom of their fist. These are the kinds of strikes the named officer can be seen using on the BWC recording. He was delivering these strikes while holding his handcuffs by their chain, which would have caused the bottom bracelet of the named officer’s handcuff to connect with the subject’s head. The witness officer confirmed these strikes made contact with the subject’s head. Furthermore, by the time the named officer truck him on his head, he was lying on his stomach with two officers holding his arms behind his back. The named officer stated he used force on the subject because he wanted to overcome his resistance and affect a lawful arrest.

Both named officers acknowledged that they did not activate their body-worn cameras. Both named officers stated they responded to a call involving a fight and they both spoke to the reporting party. The named officers stated they did not have any contact with any other parties on scene. One named officer tated she did not recall the specifics of the conversation with the reporting party, but he was asked if he was hurt and told the officers about a traffic collision. The same named officer stated that the situation did not warrant body-worn camera activation because they, “determined after speaking with the reporting party that it was just a 518, with no injuries as a result of the collision.” A second named officer stated that the reporting party told them that he requested police assistance because he was uncomfortable handling the situation alone. The same named officer stated that although they were the first officers to peak to the reporting party, they had been there a short period of time before another police unit took over and they were dispatched to another call. The second named officer stated that based on the reporting party’s statement, and lack of evidence that a fight had occurred, they determined that the situation wa only a traffic collision, and BWC activation was not required. Both named officers stated they did not recall if the reporting party mentioned a fight. Department of Emergency Management records show the named officers, along with several other police units, were responding to a call that was initially labeled a “Priority A, Type 418-Fight No Weapon”. After the named officers were on-scene and interviewing the reporting party, comments were added by other police units describing the situation as an “exchange of information only” and “no merit to 240 or 418.” SFPD General Order 10.11 states in part, “All on-scene members equipped with a BWC shall activate their BWC equipment to record in the following circumstances… Consensual encounters where the member suspects that the citizen may have knowledge of criminal activity as a suspect, witness, or victim.” While a mere exchange of information related to a traffic collision may not require activation of BWCs, an investigation of a reported fight would require activation under DGO 10.11.

As they continued to argue, the named officer clapped his hands and said to the complainant, “Yeah! Yeah! Run your mouth!” The officer also says, “You need to shut the fuck up. You understand that?” The arrestee responds, “Or else you gonna fuck me up again?” The officer the say, “Yes.” Arrestee responds, “Seriously, you’re gonna fuck me up again?” Officer whispers, “Seriously, fuck you!” The named officer also tells arrestee that the reason arrestee is unable to have a relationship with a woman is because he is a ex registrant. The named officer acknowledged using profanity. He stated that he used profanity to drive his point because the arrestee was already on verbal tirade. He also stated that in his prior contacts with the complainant, courteous words and tone did not work. He stated that he was trying to control the arrestee. However, the arrestee was handcuffed and seated amongst several uniformed, armed officers who would have been able to quickly subdue arrestee if he became physically aggressive.

The named officer did not recall making the required entry and stated he believed the primary unit officer or the recruit officer was responsible for entering the required data. The named officer stated he did not know who initiated the detention between him and his recruit, as they both exited the car and detained the subjects at about the same time.

CATEGORY OF CONDUCT:                     ND       FINDING:          S       DEPT. ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: During the DPA investigation, the named officer’s BWC recording began in the middle of the suspect’s statement and appeared to have been activated late. The named officer stated that he did not activate his BWC immediately upon arrival to the scene because he had not yet determined whether or not there was a crime, and he was not going to record something with no evidentiary value. The named officer said he was trying to calm down a boy who was crying while the suspect was giving him the back story. The named officer stated that he activated his BWC when the uspect began to speak of what happened that day. He said he recognized at that point that the information would be helpful for evidentiary purposes. The named officer’s BWC recording starts when he is speaking with the individual who assaulted the complainants. She was crying and appeared to be discussing the earlier confrontation with the complainants. According to the time stamp on the recordings, the named officer activated his BWC more than five minutes after his partner activated his. His partner’s BWC was activated at the start of hi conversation with the complainants, right after walking up the stairs into the residence. Records from the Department of Emergency Management show that the named officers responded to an incident, categorized as an “A” priority call 240 Assault/Battery. SFPD General Order 10.11, Body Worn Cameras, requires that officers activate their BWC’s during “consensual encounters where the member suspects that the citizen may have knowledge of criminal activity as a suspect, witness, or victim,” and “during any citizen encounter that becomes hostile.” In thi case, the named officer and his partner were responding to a reported assault in a residence, immediately began interacting with the involved parties and viewing the location of the alleged incident when they entered the residence. Under these circumstances, the named officer was required to activate his BWC upon entering the home, as his partner did, but he failed to do so. A preponderance of the evidence proved that the conduct complained of did occur, and that using as a tandard the applicable regulations of the Department, the conduct was improper.',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The complainant stated his dog was quarantined after biting someone. During the investigation, the DPA viewed BWC recordings that showed the named officer appearing to speak inappropriately. The named officer said his behavior was appropriate, given the chaotic nature of the incident and his need to gain control over the situation. He noted that he was called to a fight and did not know that a dog wa involved. He also highlighted the fact that when he arrived, the dog was still off leash. The named officer tated that an elderly man in the house was described as intoxicated and appeared to be so when he spoke to him. He said he was “frustrated,” because of the dog bite causing a serious injury to a female and described it as “kind of a curve ball.” A witness officer, the named officer’s partner during the incident, viewed the BWC recording and stated he would not have handled the situation the way the named officer did. He also said the named officer could have spoken in a different manner. The BWC recordings show the named officer shouting at the dog-bite victim as he enters the complainant’s home. The recording shows the named officer twice telling the occupants to “shut up.” The named officer is also seen accusing an elderly occupant of the home of being drunk and telling him hi “story sucks.” SFPD General Order 2.01, General Rules of Conduct, states in part, “When acting in the performance of their duties, while on or off duty, members shall treat the public with courtesy and respect and not use harsh, profane or uncivil language.” The situation was chaotic and unexpected, and a dangerous dog was present and still posing a risk to the named officer and others. However, the named officer continued a dismissive and rude attitude, even after the dog was safely secured. He did so while engaging with a woman in distress, and the relatively calm, and polite complainant. The named officer also acted unprofessionally when speaking with the elderly man, who was soft-spoken, even if incoherent. The named officer should have been able to be firm with the parties, even in a chaotic, frustrating situation, without acting unprofessionally and rude.

The named officer stated he did not activate his BWC because he had not detained the complainant. The complainant had decided to leave the store of this own accord. Additionally, the named officer did not uspect the complainant had committed a crime. The named officer approached to complainant to speak with him, not investigate his actions. The named officer acknowledged the footage would have had evidentiary value, but only as it pertained to the complainant’s allegations against him. He did not know a complaint would be filed against him at the time of the incident. The SFPD Legal division was unable to locate any BWC from the named officer at the time of the incident.

The named officers stated they did not immediately activate their BWCs because they initially misunderstood the complainant’s allegation. The initial comment on the CAD mischaracterized the allegation. It stated the complainant had been accosted by a security guard. While the CAD was labeled a a 240, a battery, the officers contend the initial comment provides greater detail into a reporting party’ allegations. When the complainant stated he’d been attacked, the named officers activated their BWC. The named officers’ BWC footage shows them returning to the complainant’s apartment door. The named officers and the complainant speak. The complainant is angry and asks what they want. The named officers state they want to continue the interview. The complainant yells about being beaten up and swear at the named officers. The named officers interview the complainant. The CAD lists the incident as a battery; however, its initial comment states the complainant’s allegation is he was accosted by a security guard.

Since the named officers believed there was no criminal activity, they thought their initial conversation with the complainant held no evidentiary value. The named officers stated they learned the complainant had been attacked within five minutes of speaking with him. When they learned he’d been attacked, they activated their BWCs.

The named officer stated that he was trained to be a field-training officer. The named officer was aware that he was the recruit officer’s supervisor in the field and that he was to provide an example of exemplary officer behavior to the recruit officer. The named officer stated that he did not discuss a plan or tactic before engaging with the arrestee.

The named officer stated that he pushed the complainant during a crowd control event. Before the officer encountered the complainant, officers had given multiple orders to clear the scene. The named officer tated that dozens of individuals heard, understood and complied with these orders. The complainant did not. She remained on scene. The named officer joined a skirmish line designed to clear the remaining crowd who refused to comply with earlier orders to clear the scene. When the skirmish line began moving forward, the named officer ordered the remaining crowd to clear the scene. The complainant turned and walked.

The named officer stated he believed the complainant understood she was forcing her back into officers. He stated she was engaged in passive noncompliance and the named officer gave the complainant an open-handed push. The named officer stated that, if he had not pushed the complainant, he would have had to stop and would have failed to fulfill the orders given to him by his supervisors.

The complainant then appears to walk directly to the self-checkout area to speak with the named officer. The named officer speaks to the complainant and while he is speaking to her, he takes out his handcuffs and shows them to her. After a few moments, the complainant exits the store. The post-basic coursework presents the characteristics of an effective investigative report in the title chapter “Investigative Report Writing.” It states all investigative reports must be factual, accurate, clear, concise, complete and timely. The workbook states factual reports provide an objective accounting of relevant facts related to the fact or incident under investigation. A clear report should have no doubt or confusion on what the investigating officer is reporting. Clarity is achieved by using the appropriate language in a logical order.

The named officer stated she was on scene as a back-up officer during the complainant’s detention. She aid she was about 25 to 30 feet away from the complainant and the officer detaining her. The named officer stated she could not hear what the detaining officer and complainant were saying, and she was not “involved” in the detention. She stated she spoke with the child she assumed was the complainant’ daughter while present. She said she was consoling the girl, who was crying. The named officer stated she was wearing her camera during the call but did not activate it because it was not required by Department policy.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: While investigating this complaint, the DPA found that the named officer had not activated his body-worn camera (BWC) when interviewing the complainant. The named officer stated that the call to service was listed as an aggravated assault and an assault with a deadly weapon. When he met with the complainant, she had her eyes closed and kept screaming she wanted to go to the hospital. The complainant continued screaming as the named officer attempted to interview her. She did not answer his questions. Instead, she only insisted on going to the hospital. It wa named officer’s opinion the complainant did not show signs of being pepper sprayed. The named officer explained he did not activate his BWC because he could not determine if a crime had occurred. The CAD shows named officer responded to an aggravated assault and an assault with a deadly weapon. It was an “A” Priority call, which is the highest priority call SFPD officers can respond to. The CAD indicated the complainant had been sprayed with mace. The complainant’s hospital records from the night of the attack diagnose her as suffering from pepper spray poisoning.

When he interviewed the complainant, she could not open her eyes and was screaming to be taken to the hospital. The complainant was the victim of a crime. Additionally, the BWC footage would have held evidentiary value. It would have documented the complainant’s injuries, her state of mind, her responses to named officer’s questions, potential witnesses, and the state of the scene.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: During the investigation, the DPA watched BWC recordings from each officer and discovered potential violations of Department policy. One named officer stated he muted his BWC to engage in a conversation with a lead investigator about how to proceed with the stop of a car possibly involved in recent burglaries. The other named officer said he did not active her BWC once on scene because she was only standing in the background. One of the named officer’s BWC recording shows that, at one point, he stated he was muting his camera while he called an investigator. The recording remained muted after he completed the phone call and remained muted through the time that he seized the phones from the complainant and her companions. The other named officer’s BWC recording shows that she activated her camera while she was filling out documentation regarding the seized phones on the trunk of the seized vehicle. The 30 seconds of buffering before she activated her camera shows that she had already been handling the phones and had placed them in evidence envelopes. Other BWC recordings show that the phones were seized by the other named officer ten minutes before this named officer activated her camera, at least six minutes after she wa tanding at the rear of the car, and approximately three minutes after the complainant and her companion became hostile. DGO 10.11, Body Worn Cameras, states in part:        All on-scene members equipped with a BWC shall activate their BWC equipment to        record in the following circumstances:        1.

In any situation when the recording would be valuable for evidentiary purpose … Once the BWC has been activated, members shall continue using the BWC until their involvement in the event has concluded to ensure the integrity of the recording, unless the SFPD Bulletin 17-156, Body Worn Camera Mute Function, states in part: “Utilizing the mute feature i considered a termination of the recording as outlined by Department General Order 10.11 …” The first named officer appropriately activated his BWC when he initiated the detention. He also appropriately muted the BWC when he called an investigator, away from the subjects, to discuss law enforcement tactics. However, the named officer did not unmute his BWC after his conversation concluded, and he once again began to speak with the subjects. His BWC remained muted as he seized the phones. There was no justification for this continued muting. The second officer should have activated her BWC when she arrived on scene to a detention. It should have been clear that the complainant and her companions were not free to leave while their car wa topped, and their phones were being taken from them. If there was any ambiguity regarding a detention of persons, once the second named officer moved to the rear of the car, and saw the phones being seized, her recording would have been valuable for evidentiary purposes; and soon after, her recording would have captured a citizen encounter that became hostile. Both named officers violated Department policy regarding BWC’s. A preponderance of the evidence proved that the conduct complained of did occur and that, using as a tandard the applicable regulations of the Department, the conduct was improper.

The named officer stated the vehicle matched the description perfectly and he had enough probable cause because the phones were associated with the car. The complainant’s cell phone was not in the car at any point during the detention, and therefore, not in plain view of any of the officers. Additionally, the officers on scene did not believe the complainant wa involved in the burglaries. A cell phone in a person’s pocket, not related to the actual crime being investigated, cannot be seized without a warrant for the person being searched.

He stated he typically documents deactivation in the CAD, but in this case, after riding with the complainant to the hospital, he went to another call and didn’t have access to the CAD.

Records from the Department of Emergency Management show that the named officers responded to a call created at 09:52:12. According to the records, the first unit reported they were on scene at 10:17:32. The named sergeant reported he was on scene at 10:30:24. The incident report, authored by one of the named officers, states:         I presented [the complainant] with her completed shoplifting citation … which she signed         in my presence and also provided a thumb print on the back. I provided [the complainant]         with her copy of the citation and [another named officer] removed her handcuffs … [the         complainant was cited for 459.5 PC (shoplifting) and released on scene.

Department General Order 5.01, Use of Force, states, “when notified of the use of force, the supervisor hall conduct a supervisorial evaluation to determine whether the force used appears reasonable…The upervisor shall…ensure the scene is secure and observe injured subjects or officers…” Department General Order 5.06, Citation Release, states, “It is the policy of the San Francisco Police Department, in accordance with state law, that officers cite and release all persons arrested for misdemeanor and infraction offences. … If the person is eligible for citation release, cite and release him/her at the location of arrest.” It also states, “When a person is arrested for a misdemeanor or an infraction and it is later determined that he/she is eligible for a citation release, an officer shall promptly cite and release the person at any time prior to the Sheriff Department assuming custody.” The complainant was properly detained, and then cited at the scene. After she was cited, however, the concern is whether she should have been released when the citation process was complete. The citation and release policy only states that a subject should be released at the location of arrest, only emphasizing timing when addressing a later determination that someone may be eligible for cite and release. Even then, it allows flexibility in timing of the release. There was insufficient evidence to either prove or disprove the allegation.',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The complainants stated that the named officer told them through an interpreter that they had to move out because they keep fighting and keep calling the police. Evidence from officers’ body worn cameras revealed that the named officer confirmed that the master tenant was already in the eviction process and provided him favorable guidance on where to seek further assistance. The named officer stated her remarks were consistent with Academy training to attempt to resolve landlord/tenant disputes to avoid further escalation between the parties. The named officer also said her remarks to the master tenant were based on previous information the master tenant revealed to her. And, the remarks towards the complainants to move out she said were just suggestions on how to go forward because she did not want to keep coming back to the same fighting household, perpetuating a bad living ituation without finding a resolution. SFPD tenant/landlord dispute order requires officers to provide proper referrals to the parties involved in civil aspects of a dispute. Once the dispute is stabilized, officers must focus on any criminal conduct. In handling civil aspects of landlord/tenant disputes, the officers can mediate the dispute in an attempt to get the parties to resolve the problem themselves. If the involved parties are unable or refuse to come to an agreement, then an officer’s only other option is to refer them to conflict resolution. Officers may provide only reference to applicable Civil Code Sections but must refrain from giving the parties legal advice on civil remedies. Officer need only to remember one word about giving specific legal advice – DON’T.

The named officers acknowledged that they responded to a call regarding a possible assault and battery and that they spoke to the complainant, who was a potential victim of a crime. The first named officer tated that he did not activate his BWC because he did not feel it was necessary. The second named officer stated that he did not activate his BWC because he was in field training and was nervous. Department of Emergency Management (DEM) records indicated that the call for service was dispatched as an Assault/Battery. DEM records indicated that the complainant reported that he was assaulted, that he was injured but did not need an ambulance, and that the suspect was in the unit across from the complainant’s unit. DEM records indicated that the named officers responded to the incident and spoke to the complainant. Department General Order 10.11 states, in relevant part: I. Purpose, “The use of Body Worn Cameras (BWC) is an effective tool a law enforcement agency can use to demonstrate its commitment to transparency, ensure the accountability of its members, increase the public’s trust in officers, and protect its members from unjustified complaints of misconduct….” III.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: Body Worn Camera footage shows the named officer did not turn on their BWC until they conducted a search incident to arrest. The named officers acknowledged they initially detained the complainant because named officer #1 witnessed the complainant drinking out of an alcoholic beverage container in public, in violation of CPC ection 22210. The named officers also acknowledged that they discussed with one another the intention to approach the observed suspect regarding the criminal behavior. The named officers also acknowledged they conducted a pat search on the suspect, in which they located a concealed baton. The officers then conducted a search incident to the arrest. Named officer #1 stated he did not turn on his BWC until the very end of the search incident to arrest. He contended that DGO 10.11 directed that he must turn on hi BWC during the incident; but did not specify at the beginning of the encounter. Named officer #2 stated he did not turn on his BWC when he suspected the complainant of a crime because, “it was like a fluid ituation,” and he forgot until the end of the encounter.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: During the course of its investigation, the DPA requested footage from the named officers’ Body Worn Cameras (BWC). SFPD Legal responded that responsive recordings did not exist. Named officer #1 stated he responded to a call for service for assault/battery as noted in the CAD. He acknowledged he met with the complainant who reported she was a victim of an assault. Named officer #1 stated he did not remember if he activated his BWC. Named officer #2 stated he responded to a call for service for assault/battery as noted in the CAD. He acknowledged he met with the complainant who reported she was a victim of an assault. Named officer #2 stated he did not turn on his BWC when he arrived on-scene because he had not established a crime had occurred and that he uses the call for service in the CAD as a “guideline.” He stated his interaction with the complainant was “so fluid and quick that I went searching [for the subject] before I got to the point of turning on the camera.” The CAD documents the call for service as assault/battery.

In addition, he stated he did not have time to turn on his BWC during his interaction with the complainant, even though he interacted with her for nearly four minutes. Because the call for service in the CAD was for an assault/battery, named officer #2 should have suspected he was going to have a consensual encounter with a citizen who may have knowledge of criminal activity as outlined in DGO 10.11.

The complainant stated he needed to ee a Use of Force Log. The named officer stated that he poked the complainant to get his attention because he was not listening. He stated he was trying to defuse the situation. The named officer denied that his actions constituted use of force. Witness officers denied that force was used on the complainant during this incident. BWC video showed the named officer lightly poke the complainant in the right shoulder several times. The named officer is not seen grabbing the complainant. SFPD Department General Order 5.01, Use of Force, section II. defines personal body weapons and reportable force, as follows:        D.

Any use of force           involving the use of personal body weapons, chemical agents, impact weapons, extended range           impact weapons, vehicle interventions, and firearms. Any intentional pointing of a firearm. The evidence proved that the named officer lightly poked the complainant on his shoulder.

An officer in plainclothes responded to a gun call and conducted surveillance on the complainant. During the officer’s investigation, he saw an imprint of a firearm on the complainant’s sweatshirt pocket, prompting him to believe that the complainant was in possession of a firearm. When the complainant left in a vehicle with a firearm in his possession, it was reasonable for the officer to consider the situation aggravated requiring immediate action in order to protect life and people getting harmed.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The complainant observed the named officer detaining an individual. The named officer ran the plates of a vehicle, determined the car was stolen, and pulled up behind it. Several of the car’s occupants got out, and the vehicle fled when the officer approached it. The named officer ubsequently detained an individual he identified as a possible occupant of the vehicle. The named officer stated that he observed the individual standing around the vehicle. He stated that it appeared as if the detainee and three other individuals had just stepped out of the car because he saw the car door closing. The named officer explained that occupants of stolen vehicles are often involved in criminal activities, giving him reasonable suspicion for the detention. A witness officer stated that he did not observe anyone actually getting out of the car, but he did see people near the vehicle. The witness officer did not remember whether or not the occupants of the vehicle were talking to the driver. He said the individual was likely detained because he was in or around the tolen vehicle, but he could not articulate any other reasons for the detention. Department records indicate that the individual was detained because officers observed him and three others “around” a stolen vehicle before entering a gas station store. Body worn camera footage only captured the named officer’s attempt to detain the individual. No witnesses were identified. Department General Order (DGO) 5.03, Policy B states, “A police officer may briefly detain a person for questioning or request identification only if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person’ behavior is related to criminal activity. The officer, however, must have specific and articulable facts to upport his/her action; a mere suspicion or “hunch” is not sufficient cause to detain a person or to request identification.” The evidence proves that the named officer detained the individual merely because the individual was in the proximity of a stolen vehicle.

The named officers stated they responded to a call about a mentally disturbed person who was in an altered mental state. The officers stated the detainee was uncooperative and tried to flee from the detention. The officers denied that there was any reportable use of force or any complaint of pain, injuries or visible injuries from the detainee. The officers stated the detainee was not injured nor did he claim to be injured. The officers stated the detainee did not complain of pain beyond the use of the physical control by the officers. The officers stated they used physical control to briefly detain the man until medics arrived. The officers stated medics subsequently evaluated and transported the detainee in soft restraints to a nearby hospital. The named officers stated the call concluded as “medical only.” DGO 5.01 II. (F) states that a reportable use of force occurs when officers use any force in overcoming a subject’s resistance that results in complaint of injury or pain that persists beyond the use of a physical control. The SFPD Body Worn Camera (BWC) video revealed that the officers briefly detained and handcuffed him at the scene until the medics arrived. The man was not apparently physically injured, nor did he claim to be injured, beyond repeatedly yelling and saying, “ouch” and “owie” while he was subdued and handcuffed. The BWC video also documents that the SFFD medics examined the man and told the officers that the man was just “upset.” A witness stated she did not observe the incident when the officers arrived. Another witness stated she left the scene before the officers responded. A witness victim stated he was at the scene when the officers arrived.

However, the named officer had recovered the vehicle several weeks prior to the stop. The named officer stated that he and his Field Training Officer (FTO) recovered the complainant’s stolen vehicle. The named officer stated that the vehicle’s front license plate was not attached to the bumper, but was found in the back seat. The named officer stated that he indicated that the front plate was “missing” on the face sheet of his supplemental incident report, but wrote in the narrative, that it was found in the back seat. The named officer said he completed his incident report with the guidance of his FTO. The named officer stated that he believed it was correct to mark the plate as “missing” because it was not attached to the vehicle’s front bumper. The named officer’s FTO stated that he assisted the named officer with the vehicle recovery and reviewed his incident report. A subject matter expert (SME) stated that reporting officers are required to report stolen and recovered vehicles to a section of the SFPD called “Auto Statis.” The SME stated that the incident report face sheet would normally be faxed to Auto Statis, and the reporting officer would call to confirm that the report wa received. The SME stated that if the face sheet indicated that the front plate was “missing” when a stolen vehicle was recovered, Auto Statis would keep that plate in a law enforcement database. The expert stated that officers that queried the license plate would see that the plate was still considered stolen, although the car itself was recovered. The SME stated that it would be the responsibility of the reporting officer to inform Auto Statis if the plate was actually recovered along with the automobile, even if this wa indicated in the report’s narrative. The SME stated that if the named officer had done this, he would have been told to correct the face sheet, and the plate would have been removed from the database altogether. Three SFPD officers who stopped the car after it was previously recovered stated that they had queried the license plate and found that it was still considered stolen. Those officers stopped the vehicle with gun drawn and forced the driver, the complainant’s 67-year-old father, out of the car. Those officer determined that the information about the front plate had been incorrectly reported when the vehicle wa recovered. Those officers added a supplemental report to the original stolen vehicle report, and ensured that the plate was removed from the law enforcement database.

The named officer stated that he was a Field Training Officer on the date of the vehicle recovery. The named officer stated he assisted his recruit with the vehicle recovery and then reviewed his recruit’ incident report to evaluate his abilities. When asked whether it was accurate to mark the front plate a “missing” when it was actually located in the vehicle, the named officer stated, “I don’t know if that wa an error or not.” He did not recall reviewing that portion of the report with his recruit. The named officer’s recruit stated that he marked the front plate as missing on his report, because it wa not attached to the bumper, although it was in the back seat of the recovered car. The officer stated he believed this was the correct procedure, and was not told by the named officer that there was any problem with his report. A subject matter expert stated that marking the plate as missing on the face sheet of the recovered vehicle report was a mistake, and that it would have caused the plate to still show as stolen when queried by law enforcement.

The PSA, in a DPA interview, acknowledged that she was trained at the Academy that SFPD policy prohibits PSAs from writing domestic violence reports. She acknowledged receiving a written list while she was in training that includes DV cases among those specifically prohibited for PSAs to take. She also acknowledged that she did not receive the domestic violence training that officers receive that qualifies them to take such reports.

The PSA said she did not recall who authorized her to prepare the report. The written list, however, list “Domestic Violence” among a list of ten type of reports that PSAs cannot write. In a DPA interview, the sergeant who reviewed the PSA’s report said he also believed that the PSA could write reports such as the one in this case, with approval. He could not recall who authorized the PSA to take the report in this case either. The report is inaccurate and incomplete.

No data regarding the long domestic violence history that resulted in a permanent restraining order was noted. The sergeant who reviewed the report and the Department’s subject matter expert on domestic violence investigation both stated there was no violation of the restraining order in this case, but their interview made it clear that PSAs are allowed to prepare domestic violence related reports at numerous station against Department policy and training. This practice causes the miscoding of reports and affects the proper assignment of cases, causes victim referrals for follow-up to the incorrect units, and increases the potential to weaken prosecutions. The Department’s subject matter expert on domestic violence investigation stated that he frequently see domestic violence reports prepared by PSAs in his investigation of stalking cases, and noted that several captains allow this practice. The subject matter expert stated the written policy issued to PSAs at the Academy should be enforced. He stated the only reason given that he is aware of is that officers are too busy.

The Body Worn Camera footage shows the complainant repeatedly asking for the named officers’ names. The footage shows one named officer providing her name and star number repeatedly and the other named officer saying it was already provided. The evidence proved that the act alleged in the complaint did not occur or that the named officers were not involved in the act alleged. DPA-ADDED SUMMARY ALLEGATIONS #1-4: The officers failed to comply with DGO 10.11, Body Worn Cameras. CATEGORY OF CONDUCT:                   ND        FINDING:          S       DEPT. ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: All of the named officers activated their Body Worn Cameras (BWC) during thi incident. However, BWC footage begins and ends at different times for each of the named officers. The named officers admitted they could have began recording earlier in their encounters with the complainant. One of the named officers also stated that he could have had his camera on while engaged in using force and while the complainant was hostile. The BWC footage for the two named officers who initially detained the complainant does not show the beginning of the detention. One clip begins when the named officers are already standing at the complainant’s vehicle and their investigation is in process. That video shows the named officer speaking to the complainant and the reporting party, but does not show the later use of force by the officers or hostile actions of the complainant. The clip for the other named officer does not begin until nearly the end of the encounter, when physical force is being used against the complainant. The BWC footage for the named officers who arrived later in the detention only captures the moments after force was used and the complainant is standing, un-handcuffed, free to leave. Their footage captures the final seconds of the incident, as the complainant yells at the officers and then walks away.

DPA-ADDED SUMMARY ALLEGATION #5: The officer failed to comply with Department Bulletin 16-115, Vehicle Tow Policy & Procedure 14601/12500 CVC Enforcement. CATEGORY OF CONDUCT:                   ND        FINDING:          S       DEPT. ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The named officer admitted he did not comply with certain reporting requirements. He stated that the requirement to document the specific dates a driver was cited previously for driving with a suspended license or without a license would be difficult because the driver could have been cited anywhere, and he would not have access to that information. The named officer described thi as a policy failure, because it required the reporting of unavailable information. The named officer also made a distinction between a regular traffic stop and a collision. He argued that the Department Bulletin contemplated the former, not the latter; and that a Crime Data Warehouse (CDW) report would be made for the former, while a CHP form would be used for the latter. The related Traffic Collision Report – a CHP 555 form – does not reflect the specific dates the driver wa cited for violating CVC 14601.1(a), whether a DMV 310 form was completed, or whether the complainant’s license was seized. Department Bulletin 16-115, Vehicle Tow Policy & Procedure 14601/12500 CVC Enforcement, states, “the officer shall follow the reporting procedures set forth in DB 16-114 ‘New Reporting & Procedure 14601/12500CVC Enforcement.’” DB 16-144 provides a number of reporting requirements when documenting 14601/12500 CVC enforcement. It states that the narrative shall contain the following information: “… [whether] DMV 310 form was completed … [whether the] driver’s license was seized … Specific dates driver was cited for 12500(a) CVC or 14601.1(a) CVC …” The bulletin also specifies additional requirements for a non-injury traffic collision, but specifies that a CDW report should be completed. The bulletin makes a distinction for injury collisions, stating that a CHP collision report should be made rather than a CDW report; but it reiterates that, in either case, all the reporting requirements would apply.

DPA-ADDED SUMMARY ALLEGATION #6: The officer failed to comply with Department Bulletin 16-208, eStop Contact Data Collection Program. CATEGORY OF CONDUCT:                   ND        FINDING:          S      DEPT. ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: A request to the SFPD Legal Division for eStop information documenting thi top led to the following response: “After a comprehensive search, SFPD was unable to locate any eStop results matching the information provided.” The named officer admitted it was his responsibility to collect eStop information and that he did not do so for this incident. Department Bulletin 16-208, eStop Contact Data Collection Program, states, “eStop entries are required when a stop is initiated based on information developed by the member’s own observation, or the direction and information from another member or members of the public.” A preponderance of the evidence proved the conduct complained of did occur, and using as a standard the applicable regulations of the Department, the conduct was improper.',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The incident report prepared by the named officer lacked required information and contained errors. The named officer stated he made a mistake in the report when he wrote that he handcuffed and placed the complainant in the patrol car. He acknowledged that it was his partner who did that. The named officer also stated that he forgot to include the search of the vehicle in his report narrative. He stated he did not include the search of the complainant because he did not know who had done the search. The named officer also acknowledged that he did not identify the other officers who assisted with the detention of the complainant. The incident report states that the named officer placed the complainant in his department-issued handcuffs and placed her in a patrol vehicle. BWC footage documents that the named officer and his partner searched the complainant’s vehicle, including the trunk. The footage shows the named officer’s partner handcuffing and searching the complainant. The footage from other officers on scene shows that they assisted with the detention and handcuffing of the complainant, as well as a computer check for wants and warrants. The SFPD Report Writing Manual states that it is, “essential that [officers’] reports be detailed and complete.” It goes on to state, “An accurate and comprehensive narrative must, as applicable … Outline the investigative process, including actions by Department members and units … [and] Detail searches,” among other things. A preponderance of the evidence proved the conduct complained of did occur, and using as a standard the applicable regulations of the Department, the conduct was improper.

       "       'SUMMARY OF DPA-ADDED ALLEGATIONS #2-5: The officers failed to comply with DGO 10.11, Body Worn Cameras, and DB 17-156, Body Worn Camera Mute Function. CATEGORY OF CONDUCT:                   ND         FINDING:          S      DEPT. ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The Body Worn Camera (BWC) footage for the officers showed that most did not activate their cameras at the beginning of their contact with the complainant. The footage for all of the named officers was also muted several times, and the reason for having done so was not documented. The named officers acknowledged delays in the initiation of their recordings. One of the named officer tated that when he first approached the complainant, he did not know he was going to detain her, though he acknowledged the policy also includes requirements about consensual encounters. Other named officers stated they were more concerned with other issues, such as officer safety, or that the incident wa dynamic. The named officers stated that they nonetheless complied with Department policy because, although they are required to activate their BWC’s during a detention, there is no specific guidance given about when they have to start their recording. The named officers admitted that the initial report did not document a reason for muting their BWC’s, but stated that it was documented in a supplemental report, which was written nearly seven months after the initial report. Although the supplemental report wa written by only one of the named officers, other named officers stated that they did not believe it wa necessary for each member to separately document the reason for muting their BWC’s. Some of the named officers acknowledged that they simply forgot to unmute their cameras after initially having a legitimate reason for muting. The BWC footage shows the detention of the complainant, the search of her vehicle, and her eventual release. The footage also shows that the complainant, and some of her family members, were hostile – houting, using foul language, and accusing the officers of wasting time on a taser instead of what they considered more important matters. The footage for three of the named officers starts after their initial contact with the complainant. The footage for all of the named officers is muted at various times. The supplemental report states: “While on scene, I along with other Officers … muted our (b1) body worn cameras to discuss law enforcement information and tactics amongst ourselves. This happened several times during the course of investigating this incident while we were on scene.” DATE OF COMPLAINT:               10/24/17 DATE OF COMPLETION: 07/30/18 PAGE# 8 of 8 SFPD General Order 10.11, Body Worn Cameras, states, “All on-scene members equipped with a BWC hall activate their BWC equipment to record in the following circumstances … Detentions and arrests … Consensual encounters where the member suspects that the citizen may have knowledge of criminal activity as a suspect, witness, or victim … During any citizen encounter that becomes hostile … [and] In any situation when the recording would be valuable for evidentiary purposes,” among other circumstances. It further requires that, “If a member deactivates a BWC recording prior to the conclusion of an event, the member shall document the reason(s) for terminating the recording in CAD, an incident report, a written statement or a memorandum.” Department Bulletin 17-156 clarifies that, “Utilizing the mute feature is considered a termination of the recording as outlined by Department General Order 10.11,” and it explains that muting should be documented just as if officers had terminated their recording. The SFPD Report Writing Manual states, “Reports shall be completed and submitted for review as soon as possible after the information has been received.” The supplemental report was written nearly seven months after the initial report, and it was written after the author was noticed to appear at the DPA for an interview regarding this case. The named officer did not have a reason for the long delay, or an explanation as to what motivated him to write the report a few days before his DPA interview. It is clear that, but for the allegation involving BWC’s and the named officer’s notice of such allegation, he would not have documented a reason for the BWC muting. Furthermore, the explanation given does not explain or excuse all of the muting evident from the BWC footage. All of the members who muted their BWC should have documented their own reasons for doing o, if not in the incident report, then using one of the other methods outlined in Department policy. Additionally, the named officers stopped or responded to the scene to investigate a possible crime. A oon as they realized there was a person who may have knowledge of the possible crime, they should have turned on their cameras, whether or not they knew that a detention was imminent or ongoing. Although DGO 10.11 does not state that officers must activate their cameras at the beginning of a detention, or “immediately,” it is clear that the intent of the rule is to capture the entire incident as soon as it is evident to an officer that it meets any of the criteria requiring activation. Otherwise, officers could activate their cameras for one second at the end of a detention, and be within policy. It is unreasonable to read the policy in such a way, even if some minor delays may be justified depending on the circumstances. A preponderance of the evidence proved the conduct complained of did occur, and using as a standard the applicable regulations of the Department, the conduct was improper.',\n",

The ergeant stated that the officers had probable cause to stop the complainant, and observed that they had limited options for doing so; even using OC would not have been an option as that would have rendered the complainant unable to see. The sergeant stated that the force used in this case was proportional to the everity of the offenses; the officers were not going to shoot the complainant, run him down with the car, or hit him with a baton.

The named officers admitted to not documenting the reasons for muting their body worn cameras in a timely manner. However, they said that they wrote memoranda after learning of the DPA’s investigation. These memoranda documented their reasons for muting or deactivating their BWC’s. The named officers’ BWC footage shows that they each muted their cameras for lengths of 18 to 38 minutes. Memoranda explaining their muting or deactivation were not completed until several month later, and after receiving notice of the allegations against them. DB 17-156 states, “If a member deactivates (mutes) the audio during an event, the member shall document the reason(s) for terminating the audio recording in CAD, an incident report, written statement or memorandum.” While DB 17-156 does not have a time limit on when officers need to document muting their body worn cameras, the purpose of the bulletin is to allow those who request and investigate SFPD officers’ body worn camera footage to know officers mute their cameras for appropriate reasons. To mute and document after the officers learn an investigation has been opened circumvents the purpose of DB 17-156.

The second named officer stated that he did not activate his camera upon arrival at the scene because the investigation was already complete, and he was just there to assist with the tow.

The named officers stated this was not a traffic stop because they drove by the complainant and told her to move her car and then she approached the officers. They stated this incident was an exception to the General Orders because they almost got in a head-on collision when the complainant opened her door into traffic. When asked if a marked unit was requested, the officers stated that they could not get on the air because it was too busy. Department General Orders 5.08 and 9.01 prohibit plainclothes officers from conducting traffic stop unless exigent circumstances, such as drunk driving, exist. Double-parking is not an exigent circumstance. The DGOs also require plainclothes officers to request a marked unit during traffic stops.

The Department will provide all members with training in interpreting techniques, roles, and ethics so that they may understand and follow confidentiality and impartiality rules for interpreters as defined by DHR.” DGO 5.20 also requires that language assistance be provided to a LEP individual through a qualified bilingual officer and if none is available, through a qualified civilian interpreter or a telephone interpreter unless exigent circumstances exist. The named officer admitted he had not undergone language testing through the Department and thus, he is not a “qualified” bilingual officer as required by DGO 5.20. Although the named officer stated that Cantonese is his first language, DGO 5.20 requires formal testing to ensure competency to interpret. By the named officer’s own admission, he violated DGO 5.20 by interpreting without DHR certification. The named officer stated he understood DGO 5.20 requirements and stated his basis for believing he could interpret without certification was that he heard the call for a Chinese-speaking officer and that he wanted to help his community.

He stated that when police arrived on the scene, he asked them to arrest the suspect. The named officer who spoke to the complainant tried to ask the complainant for details of the situation, but he stated that the complainant appeared to be intoxicated and became angry at the officer’s questions. When the named officer spoke to the other party, the other party stated that the complainant had approached him, unprovoked, and started yelling drunkenly in his face. He denied punching the complainant. The named officer also spoke to the other party’s friend. The friend’s account matched that of the other party in that they both named the complainant as the aggressor. A third party caller reported a “verbal altercation” to the dispatcher and gave a description of the aggressor that the named officer said matched that of the complainant. The named officer determined that the alleged “suspect” was in fact the victim. He did not arrest anyone at the scene and did not write an incident report, until he was informed of the OCC complaint, and consulted a sergeant, who suggested he prepare a report.

A Department of Emergency Management dispatcher commented during the complainant’s emotional battery report to 911 that there was a possible language barrier. The named officer, who acknowledged speaking to the complainant, stated that the complainant was not peaking in incomplete or fragmented sentences, was making himself clear, and remained upset about hi demands to see the hotel’s video footage, and there was, therefore, no apparent language barrier. One officer on scene said he did not hear the complainant’s communications with the named member and thus made no informed decision regarding the complainant’s English proficiency. Another officer on scene stated that he did not believe there was language barrier communicating with the complainant because the officers understood his words, and he did not have any difficulty communicating with him.

Also, despite being an integral part of the approval process for interagency operation requests, he keeps no record of those requests or of any permission granted.

Although he stated that the Deputy Chief’s permission is frequently given verbally, it may be inferred from the existence of the Department’s own form for thi purpose that such permission is intended to be memorialized in writing.

Department Bulletin 14-135, Member-Initiated Driver Incapacity Proceedings (DMV Re-Examination of Drivers Form DS 427), “establishes the procedures when a driver lacks the mental or physical capacity to safely operate a vehicle and requires retesting by the Department of Motor Vehicles.” It states:        California Vehicle Code §21061 permits an officer to issue a Notice of Department of Motor        Vehicle Re-Examination to a driver who cannot safely operate a vehicle because of the driver\\'        mental or physical condition. Evidence of incapacity is defined as \"Serious physical injury or        illness or mental impairment or disorientation, which is apparent to the traffic officer\". It also state        that to initiate a DMV Re-Examination proceeding against a driver, a member shall “Complete a        Notice of Re-Examination of Driver form (DMV form DS 427) by indicating whether the DMV        re-examination is a \"priority\" or \"regular,\" describing the driver\\'s condition (serious physical        injury or illness or mental impairment or disorientation) and driving behavior, and signing the        form under penalty of perjury.” The Notice of Priority Re-Examination of Driver (DMV form DS 427) completed by the named officer tated that the complainant was contacted by police after he returned to his parked vehicle and started the motor, and that the complainant displayed the symptoms of drug influence. It also stated that the complainant said he was a chauffer for a rideshare service. The named officer stated that he prepared the Notice of Priority Re-Examination of Driver because the complainant was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs, told the officer he used Norco, a prescription narcotic analgesic, and because the complainant was working as a driver for a vehicle for hire ervice and was involved in the transportation of passengers. The named officer stated that the complainants’ status as a rideshare service driver placed him in a special position, requiring the complainant to provide not only for his safety, but for the safety of his passengers. The named officer tated that he knew from his training that narcotics analgesics can cause drowsiness and respiratory depression, and that warning labels on such prescription medications typically advise that taking thi medication may impair the ability to operate a motor vehicle.

       "       'SUMMARY OF DPA-ADDED ALLEGATION #1 continued: The named officer also stated that he knew that the only way to notify DMV of driving under the influence of drug incidents is via a DMV re-examination form. A blood test administered to the complainant after he was arrested for driving under the influence indicated that he had used cocaine within hours of the blood test, and indicated the presence of a narcotic analgesic designed for relief of pain. An audio recording of the complainant established that he told the named officer that he took pain medication for his back that morning. The Forensic Toxicologist who tested the complainant’s blood sample stated that the effect of using cocaine in combination with a narcotic analgesic can be very impairing and could have negatively affected the complainant’ comprehension, memory, reaction time, ability to divide his attention and his ability to operate a motor vehicle. The complainant’s behavior, as documented by the named officer in his incident report and by his audio and video recordings of the complainant, established that the complainant was acting in a manner consistent with being under the influence of a controlled substance. The use of cocaine in combination with a narcotic analgesic could, according to the Forensic Toxicologist, impair the complainant’s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. Such impairment would constitute the “mental impairment or disorientation” described in DB 14-135. The complainant’s role as a driver of passengers for hire placed him in a unique role, since his impairment jeopardized not only his own safety, but also that of hi passengers. The evidence established that the named officer did not fail to comply with Department regulations. The evidence proved that the act, which provided the basis for the allegation, occurred.

CATEGORY OF CONDUCT:                  ND        FINDING:        S         DEPT. ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The named officer violated his duties as a sergeant when he failed to ensure that a subordinate officer complied with DGOs 5.07 and 2.01 and took no corrective action. Department General Order 1.04 (A)(1)(c) states that sergeants shall “require all assigned members to comply with the policies and procedures of the Department, and take appropriate action when violations occur.” DGO 1.04 (A)(1)(a) requires sergeants to train and lead subordinates in the performance of their duties and set an example of efficiency and deportment. When a superior officer ordered officers to respond to the homeless encampment, the superior officer pecifically directed a sergeant to go because of the prior officer-involved shooting. The superior officer tated he wanted a sergeant present to address any problems and provide information to people. As a upervisor, the named officer was responsible for ensuring that his subordinates complied with DGO 5.07 and 2.01 and to take appropriate action when the officer failed to comply. During this incident, a ubordinate officer engaged in misconduct in violation of DGOs 5.07 and 2.01. The evidence established that the named officer was aware of his subordinate’s conduct either during the incident or shortly thereafter. The evidence established that the named officer did not understand the protections that Department General Order 5.07 provides to bystanders and the requirements that officer are mandated to follow. The named officer’s conclusion that his subordinate did not violate DGO 5.07 because the complainant was able to continue filming is problematic, and more so, because of his role as a upervisor. The subordinate officer’s shining of his flashlight onto the complainant prevented her from filming the officers’ enforcement activities. Because of the officer’s interference, the film does not show the enforcement activities she was trying to record; rather, the officer’s flashlight caused a circle of light that blocked out those activities. By concluding that his subordinate acted appropriately when he shined his flashlight at the complainant who was a lawful onlooker attempting to film police activities, the named officer demonstrated that he does not understand DGO 2.01’s mandate to treat the public with respect and courtesy and DGO 5.07’ requirement that officers protect the rights of onlookers to witness and record law enforcement activities. The named officer violated his duties as a sergeant when he failed to recognize his subordinate’ noncompliance with the mandates of DGO 5.07 and 2.01 and take any action to correct his subordinate’ behavior. By a preponderance of the evidence, the named officer neglected his duties in violation of Department General Orders 1.04.',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: One of the named officers stated that a complaint regarding an officer’s off-duty conduct would not have been referred to the DPA, and this was the understanding throughout the Department: “Everybody knows OCC handles on duty allegations. Internal Affairs handles off-duty ….” The named officer did not think there was any written policy stating this, and he did not recall the distinction being discussed in Internal Affairs training. The other named officer admitted that she had a phone conversation with the complainant and submitted a copy of the conversation, which she had surreptitiously recorded, to the DPA. The officer stated in an interview that, “referring [the complainant] to OCC would have been no issue, except I believed it fell into the off-duty parameters, which is what I thought we would handle.” The officer made clear in her interview that the practice of sending on-duty conduct to OCC and keeping off-duty misconduct at SFPD Internal Affairs was not in a written policy she was aware of and was not part of IA training. The officer tated that she could not think of a scenario when she would have forwarded a complaint of off-duty conduct to the OCC/DPA. In a subsequent email, the officer cited the DPA website’s Frequently Asked Questions section, which specifically stated that the DPA takes complaints involving, “one or more SF Police Department sworn members engaged on-duty. [emphasis added]” In the recorded phone conversation between the named officer and complainant, the named officer told the complainant that he would not get much out of OCC mediation because the misconduct he alleged involved off-duty contact.

The San Francisco City Charter §4.127, in effect at the time, stated:        The Office of Citizen Complaints shall investigate all complaints of police misconduct, or that a        member of the Police Department has not properly performed a duty, except those complaint        which on their face clearly indicate that the acts complained of were proper and those complaint        lodged by other members of the Police Department. The current City Charter §4.136, states:        DPA shall promptly, fairly, and impartially investigate all complaints regarding police use of        force, misconduct or allegations that a member of the Police Department has not properly        performed a duty, except those complaints which on their face clearly indicate that the act        complained of were proper and those complaints lodged by other members of the Police        Department. The City Charter grants the OCC (now the DPA) the power to investigate complaints against police misconduct and refers to “member[s] of the Police Department.” The charter does not make a distinction between on-duty and off-duty conduct. SFPD Department General Orders also do not seem to make a distinction between on-duty and off-duty conduct; they specifically regulate off-duty conduct. DGO 2.04 makes only a clear distinction for “internal complaints,” from other members or representatives of other law enforcement or government agencies. The DGO, however, specifically limits the scope of allegation handled by the OCC to “official misconduct.” “Official misconduct” should be defined in the DGO’s, and the OCC/DPA’s jurisdiction should be more clearly defined. The evidence proved that the act by the members was justified by Departmental policy, procedure, or regulation.

If the named officer had read the email carefully, she would have recognized that complainant’ tatements indicated a possible violation of DGO 2.01. Ideally, the named officer would have asked the complainant if he was complaining of that conduct and whether he had reached out to the DPA. The question is whether it is incumbent on officers to carefully read through every email sent by the public to determine if there is alleged misconduct. This email did not state that it was a complaint and even had the name of a different officer in the subject line – an officer the complainant was praising in the body of the email. While we should expect officers to look beyond the lack of explicit language like “complaint” or “misconduct,” it is also true that some communications are not going to stand out as complaints, especially if they are not alleging serious misconduct. The named officer may also have assumed that if complainant was already communicating with Internal Affairs, he was already familiar with how and where to make complaints regarding police conduct and was apparently already speaking to the right individuals. No witnesses were identified. There was insufficient evidence to either prove or disprove the allegation. DATE OF COMPLAINT: 09/01/16 DATE OF COMPLETION: 04/27/17 PAGE # 1 of 1',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The DPA sustained two officers under the supervision of the named. In both allegations, one of unnecessary force and one of an unjustified detention, the named officer was aware of the actions because they were communicated in the narrative of the incident report. The named officer took no action to discipline the officers and the named officer approved the report. In the detention, the complainant alleged that he was detained at a homicide scene even though he did nothing criminal and was not a witness. The sustained officer admitted that he ordered the complainant detained even though the sustained officer did not suspect the complainant committed any crime. The named officer stated that the detention was justified because of a “special-needs detention.” There is no acknowledgement of these detentions in Department regulations, and Department General Order 5.03 explicitly states that “a police officer may briefly detain a person for questioning or request identification only if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person's behavior is related to criminal activity.” In the unnecessary force, the sustained officer admitted to handcuffing the complainant and taking him to a patrol vehicle. When the complainant began kicking at the vehicle and the sustained officer, the ustained officer punched the handcuffed complainant in the face. The sustained officer wrote this in the incident report. The named supervising officer conducted a use of force investigation and concluded the force was reasonable. A subject matter expert disagreed and deemed the use of force unnecessary. A preponderance of the evidence proved the conduct complained of did occur, and using as a standard the applicable regulations of the department, the conduct was improper.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The named officer detained the complainant after responding to a fight or dispute. During the detention, the officers ran a warrant check on the complainant and found two traffic infraction warrants. The officers arrested the complainant for the warrants. The complainant was also charged with public intoxication and booked into the County Jail to be released when sober. The named officer did not complete an incident report. Department Orders require members to make all required written reports of crimes or incidents requiring police attention and make written reports on crimes observed or brought to their attention that have not been previously reported. The Event History Detail documents the report of a trespasser who gained entry and was reportedly threatening a tenant. The Event History Detail also reports another tenant heard screaming coming from the room where the suspect had trespassed. Both misdemeanors were in progress at the time the officer responded to the hotel room. The named officer stated that he was not required to prepare an incident report because no one requested a Citizen’s Arrest, because the incident involved a misdemeanor committed outside their presence and because there was no stay-away order against the complainant. At the time the officer arrived at the hotel, the suspected trespasser was still inside the room from which there were reports of screaming, threats and a possible fight or dispute. This was a misdemeanor in progress, involving several individuals, one who was reported trespassing and one who was reported to be creaming from inside her room. Under the circumstances, the officers had a duty to investigate and make a written report, identifying all suspects, victims and witnesses. The named officer was the senior-ranking officer present and, therefore, the Officer-in-Charge. As the Officer-In-Charge, it was his duty to oversee that all required reports were completed. Because an incident report was not completed, the named officer neglected his duty. A preponderance of the evidence proved the conduct complained of did occur, and using as a standard the applicable regulations of the Department, the conduct was improper.',\n",

CATEGORY OF CONDUCT: ND                      FINDING: PF             DEPT. ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The complainant stated that, after ransacking his house, the officers did not leave behind a copy of the search warrant. A witness stated that although an officer left a property receipt for the items taken, he did not provide her with a copy of the warrant itself. The named officer, who was also the affiant on the search warrant, stated that he did not leave a copy of the search warrant behind because the judge who signed the warrant had sealed it. The named officer tated that, because the front page of the warrant listed other addresses to be searched and some of the target property, leaving a copy behind could telegraph police intentions to others and potentially tip them off about places to be searched and items sought. He also stated that doing so might compromise officer afety. He cited these possibilities as reasons why the judge ordered the warrant sealed. The named officer acknowledged that page 39 of the SFPD Search Warrant Manual specifies, “Once entry is made into the location, the officer(s) should show the original search warrant to the occupant(s), then give the occupants(s) a copy.” He stated that his understanding of the difference between “should” and “shall” is, “‘Shall’ means that it is required. ‘Should’ means you should do it when reasonably possible.” A review of the Search Warrant Manual showed there is no clear instruction about what to leave for an occupant when officers are serving a sealed warrant. Department General Order 5.16 does not addre officers’ responsibilities when the court has ordered a search warrant sealed. All of the officers interviewed stated that, to their knowledge, there is neither an SFPD policy nor any tatutory requirement that a copy of a search warrant must always be left behind once it is served. The evidence proved that the action complained of was the result of a policy failure.',\n",

Title the incident report \"Investigative Detention,\" list the person as \"D\" detained, and        include the reasons) the subject was detained such a long time or why he/she was moved. The named officer stated that there was no need for him to issue a Certificate of Release or write an incident report because the complainant was not handcuffed, transported to any police facility, or moved from his location. The officer stated the complainant was briefly detained, and that the incident’s CAD record did not accurately reflect the time the complainant was detained. He stated that while the CAD documented the case as being open for 54 minutes, the complainant wa already released from detention when he ran the complainant’s license plate, 32 minutes after the detention started. The named officer stated that after searching the complainant and his vehicle a block away, the named officer walked back to the complainant’s location and informed his partners that no additional narcotics were found in the vehicle. He stated they then released the complainant from detention, walked back to a street corner and hung out for about 10 to 15 minutes. The named officer tated that he then walked back to his police vehicle and ran the complainant’s license plate. The officer tated he followed such course of actions because he was alone when he searched the vehicle. The officer’s partners gave similar contentions, that the CAD record did not accurately reflect the length of time the complainant was detained. However, the two other officers present at the scene said the complainant was still detained when his license plate was run. Also, they did not recall who was present for the search of the vehicle and could not recall the sequence of events surrounding the detention and release of the complainant.

The named officer admitted that he did not provide complainant a Certificate of Release. The named officer stated that the complainant was yelling, did not want to listen to anything he had to say, and appeared ready to leave at any moment. Hotel surveillance video showed that the complainant remained present, within a few feet of the named officer, for at least one minute and 15 seconds after her handcuffs were completely removed. The named officer and complainant continued to communicate with each other during much of that time. The urveillance video did not show the named officer providing complainant with any papers or documents. The SFPD Property Control department was unable to search for a Certificate of Release without an incident number. No witnesses came forward.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: One of the named officers stated that he split from his partner during his shift and logged onto the other named officer’s vehicle computer with his username and password. The named officer stated that although his unit history indicated that he queried the complainant’s license plate, he was not present for the traffic stop and did not have any contact with the complainant. He further stated that they are not trained, it is not required, and it is not practical to log on and off of a vehicle computer each time it is used. One of the other named officers stated that he did not recall the incident, but he acknowledged that there was no record (CAD) of the incident documented in his unit history and that there was no indication that he or any other officer notified dispatch about the traffic stop. Another officer stated he could not find the CAD for the traffic stop and could not show that they communicated with dispatch regarding this call. The named officer did not log onto the vehicle computer with his username and password. The officer acknowledged that another officer may have logged on to his unit’s vehicle computer, but stated that he and his partner could continue to use the computer as long as they abided by the “Need to Know, Right To Know” standard. Records from the Department of Emergency Management showed that the named officers did not communicate with dispatch regarding the traffic stop of the complainant. A sniffer request indicated that the username or “A number” of the officer not present at the incident, was used to query the complainant’ license plate number. The E585 entry for the traffic stop had the name of one of the named officer present at the incident, but the A number of the named officer who was not present. SFPD General Order 1.03, Duties of Patrol Officers, states, “Patrol officers shall … Notify the Communications Division when an on view incident or a station assignment makes them unavailable for other assignments”; and to, “Immediately notify the Communications Division when: (1) Arriving at the cene of an assignment (10-97).

(emphasis in original)” The evidence established that the named officers did not communicate with dispatch regarding the traffic top of the complainant. As a result, there was no record of the stop that would have helped determine the identity of the involved officers, whether or not the complainant’s license plate or name was queried, or the length of the detention. The named officers failed to properly ong-on to the MVT computer with their own username and passwords, while another named officer failed to log off the vehicle computer a required.

The named officer stated that he did not review the citation prior to it being issued to the complainant. The FTO daily report documented that on the date of the incident, the recruit officer was on day 9 of phase three of FTO training. The FTO training manual states that the 3rd Phase encompasses weeks 11 through 16 of the Field Training Program, and that, “Weeks 15 & 16 are evaluation only; trainee performs as a solo officer.” A preponderance of the evidence proved that the conduct complained of did occur, and that using as a tandard the applicable regulations of the Department, the conduct was improper.',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The named officer reviewed and approved the incident report in this matter. The incident report includes that the complainant has dementia and is deaf but does not state that the complainant cannot speak. It does not document how the officers communicated with the complainant, including the Welfare and Institution Code §5150 advisement. The report refers to several residents of the facility who approached the named officer about previous assaults by the complainant. However, the report includes neither the names of these witnesses nor any details of the past incidents. The named officer said that the role of the reviewing officer on a police report is to ensure that SFPD policy is followed. The reviewing officer must also be certain that the elements of any crimes alleged are included in the report, and check for proper format, structure, and grammar. He stated that in this instance he believed the officers were communicating with the complainants via written notes, and that the complainant understood spoken conversation from her son and some of the facility staff members. He then acknowledged that this information was not in the incident report. Documenting the complainant’s inability to speak, the manner in which the officers communicated with her, and specific witness contact information and details are components of an accurate and complete incident report.

The complainant was not in his car at the time and stood at least 10-15 feet away from his vehicle, which was legally parked. In his incident report, the named officer failed to articulate the probable cause for searching the complainant’s vehicle. The named officer stated the complainant’s vehicle was parked near the scene of the complainant’s arrest, but he did not write where the car was parked.

Regardless of whether or not narcotics were found in the complainant’s vehicle, the officer was required to document his probable cause for searching the complainant’s vehicle in the narrative of his incident report.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: SFPD Bulletin 16-208, eStop – Contact Data Collection Program, states, “The new eStop program will expand the criteria to include all stops … [emphasis in the original]” The bulletin defines four categories of “stops,” including, “Any detention of a person.” The named officer stated he did not stop the complainant for a moving violation and the complainant wa free to leave at any time. The named officer stated eStop entries are not required for parking tickets, because the person is not detained. The named officer said that after determining that the complainant wa not having a medical or mechanical emergency, he told him he was going to issue him a citation for topping in a bus zone, he wrote it out, and issued it to him. The named officer stated he issued a dozen citations for the identical violation at that bus zone over the course of about half an hour. The named officer said he did make eStop entries for other stops he made on that day, but they would have probably been for moving violations. The named officer stated he would make those entries when he returned to the tation at the end of his shift. EStop records for the named officer, provided by the SFPD Legal Department, show he entered seven tops into the eStop system on the date of the complainant’s stop. None of the stops matched the stop of the complainant. The requirement that an eStop entry be made for the stop of the complainant depends upon whether the complainant was detained by the named officer. In this case, the named officer made a show of authority: he was in full uniform and told the complainant he was going to write him a citation for parking in a bu zone. An objectively reasonable person under these circumstances would feel compelled to stay until the officer finished writing the citation. The complainant here did not feel he could leave, since he stated the named officer told him to stop his vehicle and asked him a question. The named officer did not confirm he told the complainant to stop his vehicle, but admitted to asking the complainant if he was having a medical or mechanical emergency, and finding he had none, telling the complainant he was going to write him a ticket. A preponderance of the evidence proved the conduct complained of did occur, and using as a standard the applicable regulations of the Department, the conduct was improper.',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The named officer wrote a Traffic Collision Report following his investigation of a non-injury traffic collision. The motorist found at fault was cited for driving on a suspended license. The report failed to include all required information regarding the three Limited English Proficient partie involved in the collision and the actions taken by the officer who was called to provide Spanish-language interpretation services. DGO 5.20 requires that an officer preparing a report in such a circumstance include in the narrative of the report the identification of the interpreter, the primary language of the persons to whom the interpretation services were provided, and how the services were provided. The named officer stated he did not include in the report one of the persons to whom the interpreter spoke because he did not hear the man speaking Spanish. The officer’s own Body Worn Camera footage, however, indicated that the complainant spoke to medics in Spanish while in close contact with the named officer, and that the complainant failed to understand that he would receive a citation and his car would be towed until it was explained to him in Spanish. Further, Department Bulletins 16-114 and 16-115, New Reporting Procedures 14601/12500 CVC Enforcement, established comprehensive guidelines for information required in a Traffic Collision Report pertaining to a collision with a driver whose license had been suspended. The named officer acknowledged that numerous items required were not included in the report he completed. A sergeant who approved the report stated he did not find any deficiencies, and stated that while some of the required information was not specifically mentioned in the narrative of the report, there was sufficient information included in the report and attached documents that a reviewer could conclude that the complainant had engaged in the behavior for which he was cited. A sergeant identified by the Department as a subject matter expert in the requirements for traffic collision reports stated that the information required by DB 16-114 and 16-115 applied in this instance, and that there were numerous elements missing from the named officer’s report. That sergeant also stated that, while the bulletins had changed the procedures for reporting the information, the information officer were required to gather and document had not changed.

The named officer acknowledged that one of the detaining officers summoned her to the scene because of a complaint of pain from the complainant. The named officer stated that she was not required to record the incident in the Use of Force Log, because when she arrived to investigate, the complainant told her that the detaining officers did not cause her injury. The detaining officer stated that the complainant alleged that his use of physical control had caused a scratch on her arm. The officer stated that he believed the complainant may have sustained the abrasion because of the force used to detain her, so he requested a sergeant respond to the scene to conduct a Use of Force investigation. The officer stated that the named officer responded and completed a Use of Force investigation. The detaining officer’s partner corroborated his statement. In the Incident Report, the detaining officer stated that he requested a sergeant to conduct a use of force investigation. The named officer’s statement, included with the Incident Report, stated that she responded to the scene to conduct a use of force investigation. The district station’s Use of Force Log did not include an entry for this incident. SFPD General Order 5.01, Use of Force, states that officers must report, “Physical control, when the person is injured or claims to be injured.” It states that the officer is required to report such a use of force to his supervisor. That supervisor, in this case the named officer, “shall” take additional step including the recording of the use of force in the Use of Force Log.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The complainant, who is of Limited English Proficiency, was upset that she wa arrested based solely on an accusation made by her sister. The named officer – a sergeant – dispatched officers to arrest the complainant. The arresting officers requested a Spanish-speaking officer once they arrived at the station. The DPA investigated whether the named officer was justified in arresting the complainant, as well as whether he should have sent a qualified bilingual officer to arrest the complainant or whether there were any other steps he should have taken to minimize language barriers during the arrest. The named officer stated that the statement from the complainant’s sister was sufficient probable cause to arrest the complainant. He also stated that it did not occur to him that the complainant might be of Limited English Proficiency, though he was aware that her sister spoke Spanish due to the original Incident Report. An investigating sergeant stated that the probable cause for the arrest was determined by the named officer and other officers. She also stated that the case was dismissed in consultation with the District Attorney’ Office. The officers who were ordered to arrest the complainant by the named officer stated that they were given the name of the complainant, where she worked, and why they were arresting her. They realized, after the arrest, that she needed an interpreter. The Incident Report, written before the complainant’s arrest, noted that her sister – the alleged victim – primarily spoke Spanish. The report included a two-page, hand-written statement, in Spanish, from the victim. The report noted that, “the victim was crying and visibly shaken about this incident. The victim told [the officer] that she wanted shelter since she is afraid of going back to the house.” The supplemental report states that the named officer directed two other officers to go to the complainant’s workplace and arrest her. It documents that the arresting officers transported the complainant to the district station, where they requested a Spanish speaking officer. The Spanish speaking officer’s statement explained that he contacted the complainant in the back of a patrol vehicle at the district station parking lot, where he explained the Emergency Protective Order that was being served.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: During the course of the investigation, the OCC queried the SFPD Legal Division to determine if the named officer complied with Department Bulletin 14-059 regarding collecting and recording traffic stop data information. The SFPD Legal Department replied that they had no document responsive to the OCC request. The OCC then brought an OCC added allegation against the officer of Neglect of Duty for failure to comply with DB 14-059. The named officer was interviewed by OCC and stated that he is assigned to the San Francisco Police Department Airport Bureau as a motorcycle officer. The named officer stated that his motorcycle is not equipped with an MDC. The named officer stated that in order to comply with DB 14-059, airport bureau motorcycle officers complete a form regarding the E585 data entry. At the end of the officer’s watch, the form is attached to the citation and submitted to the Records room and the Records Division is responsible for making the required E585 entry. A San Francisco Police Department Subject Matter Expert (SME) was interviewed regarding procedure for Airport Bureau officers to be in compliance with DB 14-059. The SME stated that solo motorcycle officers are expected to complete the E585 “form”. The SME stated that the officer completes the form and subsequently submits the form to the Records section at the airport where it is compiled. A member of the clerical staff then completes the data entry. Motorcycle officers at the airport do not have access to a Level II terminal and are not expected to enter the E585 data into the system themselves. The officers’ ability to comply with Department Bulletin 14-059 is limited or modified in the sense they complete the form, but it’s forwarded to a location where the data entry is done by a clerk who has access to a Level II terminal. The form is entered into a spreadsheet by clerical staff and then emailed to the Planning Division of the Crime Analysis Unit. The OCC investigation revealed that there is a backlog of E585 forms at the Airport that have not been processed. The named officer completed the E585 form but it had not been processed due to the backlog. The evidence proved that the act by the member was justified by Departmental policy, procedure, or regulation; however, the OCC recommends a change in the particular policy, procedure or regulation. \\x0c                                OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS',\n",

The bicyclist stated the complainant refused to accept his apology because she wanted him arrested. The named officer acknowledged that the complainant requested a citizen’s arrest on the bicyclist. He tated he explained to the complainant the citizen’s arrest process to enlighten her about the steps that she would possibly carry out or undergo. The named officer stated the complainant then refused to cooperate with the citizen’s arrest process and walked away. Department General Order 5.04 II.8 states:        In all instances involving requests for a private person's arrest, an incident report shall be        prepared. The arresting person should be given a copy of the citation. Since the incident involves a request for a private person’s arrest, DGO 5.04 II.8 requires the named officer to prepare an incident report. The named officer stated there was no need for him to prepare an incident report because no one was detained and the complainant did not cooperate with the citizen’ arrest process. He believed the complainant had manifested withdrawal of her request for citizen’s arrest, and that it has been a practice not to write a report if one refuses to go through and not sign a citizen’ arrest form. The requirement, however, is mandatory. The language of DGO 5.04 II.8 clearly put emphasis on preparing an incident report in all cases involving a request for a private person’s arrest.

The named officer interviewed the off-duty officers and an Uber driver who had called 911, and had them write incident report statements. The evidence established that the Uber driver directed officers to the complainant and his two companions, who had been passengers in his car when the fight erupted, and that officers detained these three individuals. The off- duty officers came to the location of the detention and stated that the complainant and his companions had not assaulted them. The Uber driver accused the complainant of damaging the interior of his car and hi phone. A sergeant at the scene told the complainant he would be arrested if he did not pay the Uber driver $700.00 for the alleged damage, and the sergeant ordered two officers to escort the complainant to an ATM machine so he could withdraw cash. These two officers escorted the complainant back to the scene, where the complainant gave the Uber driver $700.00. The named officer’s partner helped the Uber driver write a Release of Liability form, which the complainant and the Uber driver signed and which the named officer’s partner signed as a witness.

The named officer stated he interviewed the off-duty officers. He denied interviewing or having contact with an Uber driver. When asked whether the section of his incident report narrative documenting hi contact with the Uber driver was accurate, the named officer stated that it was, but also stated that he did not know this individual was an Uber driver, despite the fact that the narrative identified this individual a “an Uber driver.” The named officer stated he was unaware that the Uber driver claimed his property had been damaged. The incident report statement written by the Uber driver in the presence of the named officer stated that the complainant splashed beer inside his car and broke his phone. The named officer’ incident report narrative referenced the Uber driver’s incident report statement.

The complainant was told the officers were responding to a call of a reported break-in. He stated he was carrying some dresser drawers and personal belongings to his apartment. He stated the officers asked him what he was doing, and he responded that he was moving into his apartment. They asked the complainant for identification. The complainant told them he did not have any identification on him, but he would go upstairs to his residence and get it. He stated the officers told him not to. He stated the officers followed him up the stairs. He told the officers that he did not want the officers inside his residence. He stated the officers gave him various reasons as to why they had to enter his apartment. The officers entered his apartment over his objection. The responding officers stated they responded to the complainant’s apartment regarding a prowler or burglary in progress involving more than one suspect. The officers stated they did not know whether the complainant had an accomplice or accomplices who might have still been inside the apartment, possibly holding hostages. The responding officers stated they attempted to explain to the complainant that because of the nature of the call for service, they had a duty to go inside the apartment and make sure no crime was being committed. Overriding the complainant’s objection, the officers stated they entered the complainant’s residence. After a brief search, the officers concluded that there was no merit to the call. No further action was taken and an incident report was not prepared. There is no current explicit policy requiring the preparation of an Incident Report for a non-consensual entry into a residence. However, given the significant intrusion of such a search, and the risk of injury involved, Department policy should require officers to prepare an incident report documenting the officers’ actions in such cases. The evidence proved that the act by the members of the Department was justified by Department policy, procedure, or regulation. However, the OCC recommends a change in the particular policy, procedure, or regulation. \\x0c                                OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS DATE OF COMPLAINT:            10/21/15    DATE OF COMPLETION:              10/11/16 PAGE # 5of 5',\n",

The complainant stated he was moving furniture into his new apartment when officer confronted him in the courtyard. The complainant stated officers first appeared with various assault rifle and semi-automatic weapons. The complainant expressed intimidation and anxiety by the number of officers and the display of weapons. The named officer admitted carrying an assault rifle during this encounter, and pointing it at the complainant when he first encountered the complainant. The officer stated he was carrying the weapon in the low-ready position for the protection of himself and other officers in the event the officer encountered armed suspects. The named officer denied detaining the complainant with the weapon. SFPD Department General Order 5.03, INVESTIGATIVE DETENTIONS, section II states in part: PHYSICAL RESTRAINT. If you take the detained person to a police facility or physically restrained the person, issue a Certificate of Release. QUESTIONABLE SITUATIONS. If there is doubt as to whether you should issue a Certificate of Release, always resolve the doubt by issuing the form. The OCC determined the pointing of the assault rifle at the complainant combined with the admitted detention of the complainant, was a form of physical restraint in detaining the complainant. The named officer failed to issue the complainant a Certificate of Release after the complainant was released, in violation of DGO 5.03.

The named officers also violated Department policy when they failed to request for a marked backup unit. *One named officer is on medical leave. The allegation against him has been bifurcated from thi Complaint Summary Report. The OCC case number for this named officer is now 0592-15B. This finding pertains only to three named officers. The named officers denied engaging in traffic enforcement activity, claiming they did not conduct a traffic stop because the complainant’s car was already parked. They stated they were not required to call for uniformed backup because they did not initiate a traffic stop. The named officers acknowledged that Department General Orders prohibit plainclothes officers from conducting traffic enforcement. They admitted investigating a double-parked car and issuing a parking citation while in plainclothes. However, the named officers stated that traffic enforcement is distinct from parking enforcement. The named officers stated there is no prohibition on plainclothes officers issuing parking citations. DGO 9.01 states that “moving violations shall be enforced only by uniformed officers, except as provided in DGO 5.08, Non-Uniformed Officers.” DGO 5.08 states that “non-uniformed officers shall not initiate traffic stops, issue traffic citations or make minor traffic arrests except…. [w]hen witnessing an aggravated situation requiring immediate action to protect life or property, e.g., drunk driving.” Additionally, when non-uniformed officers initiate traffic stops, they are required by DGO 5.08 to immediately call for the assistance of a marked backup unit. A traffic stop occurs any time a driver or passenger is detained for traffic enforcement purposes. The officers initiated a traffic stop when they pulled up to the complainant’s car and questioned the passenger about their reason for double-parking. The officers’ distinction between a traffic violation and a parking violation is negligible. Double-parking is a Vehicle Code violation, regardless of whether the citation i prepared as a traffic or parking citation. \\x0c                                 OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS DATE OF COMPLAINT: 11/13/15                DATE OF COMPLETION: 10/27/16                 PAGE# 6 of 6',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The named officer stated he initiated his investigation of the complainant after receiving information from a Confidential Reliable Informant. The OCC reviewed Officer’s Monthly Expenditures reports submitted by the named officer, which documented his cash payments to Confidential Reliable Informants. The review established that between January 2010 and January 2011, nine Monthly Expense Reports documenting a total of $4700 expended by the named officer (including $1700 paid to the Confidential Reliable Informant in this case), lacked the signature of a supervisor who had approved the report. No existing San Francisco Police Department regulations required a supervisor’s signature on an Officer’ Monthly Expenditures reports. However, the Officer’s Monthly Expenditures form includes a space for the officer completing the form to sign it, certifying that it “is true and correct.” Immediately underneath the officer’s signature line, there are three lines, each labeled “Approved By” and “Date Approved.” Inclusion of these three lines for supervisors’ signatures clearly indicates that the form required a upervisor’s signature of approval. Ten of the Officer’s Monthly Expenditures Reports submitted by the named officer between March 2009 and January 2010 include the signature of a supervisor who approved the report, and six of those report include the signatures of two supervisors, often a Sergeant and a Lieutenant. The inclusion of supervisors’ ignatures on these ten monthly forms in 2009 and 2010 indicates that the named officer understood that uch written approval was required. The San Francisco Police Department Informant Management Manual in effect in 2009, 2010 and 2011 failed to specifically require the approval of a supervisor for an Officer’s Monthly Expenditures report.

The named officer was, therefore, responsible for the actions of the officers who entered and searched the complainants’ residence without cause, detained the complainants without justification and pointed firearms at the complainants without justification. By extension, he was guilty of neglect of duty for failure to properly supervise subordinate officers under his immediate control by failing to require them to comply with the policies and procedure of the Department, as required by Department General Order 1.04. The named officer stated he reviewed and signed the incident report prepared by a subordinate officer in his capacity as Acting Officer in Command. He stated he believed the incident report was accurate, and did not believe there was any discrepancy between the incident report and what occurred. The named officer stated the incident report did not document the entry to the complainants’ apartment because the complainant consented to the entry. He stated the entry did not need to be documented in the incident report because it had no evidentiary value and had no bearing on the arrest of the suspect. He stated that if officers had entered the complainants’ apartment under exigent circumstances, that would have been documented in the report. As stated above, the evidence established that two or more officers from the Tactical Division responded to the scene and entered the complainants’ building to search for the victim along with the named officer. As stated above, a preponderance of the evidence established that the complainant did not consent to officers entering her apartment. The only other justification for officers entering the complainants’ apartment without consent would be an exigency, and the named officer stated that an exigent entry would require documentation in the incident report. The evidence established that the incident report made no mention of the entry to the complainant’s apartment. The entry and search of the complainants’ residence, even if conducted with her consent, would be “pertinent information” that the SFPD Report Writing Manual and Department Bulletin 14-205 require be included in incident reports. The Report Writing Manual also requires officers to outline “the investigative process, including actions by Department members and units.” The entry and search of the complainants’ apartment was part of the “investigative process” involved in locating the victim, and involved a significant action by Department members.

The named officer also approved the Operations Order for the Field operation. DGO 1.05 - Duties of Station Personnel, states in relevant part, that the district captain is responsible for the efficient operation of the station and the performance and discipline of its members. DGO 1.06 - Duties of Superior Officers, states in relevant part, Superior Officers shall guide and instruct their subordinates in the performance of their duties and require strict compliance with the policies and procedures of the Department and the orders of superiors. OCC’s investigation established that the named officer approved a Field Operations Order that due to it lack of information and review, permitted SFPD officers and officers from other law enforcement agencies to violate the Constitutional Rights of individuals without probable cause. Patrol officers were instructed to bring subjects to a police facility in order for the subjects to be evaluated by a training class.  The named officer and other officers stated that this was completely voluntary and if objected to, the ubjects would not be evaluated. This information was not documented in the Operations Order and at the very least was misinterpreted or misused by members of the SFPD and officers from other agencies in order to bring subjects into a police facility for evaluation by the training class. The complainant’s 4th Amendment rights were violated when he was subjected to a custodial arrest wherein he was handcuffed, moved, searched, and property seized from him all without probable cause, when in fact the complainant should have been immediately released after being issued a citation for minor infractions. The Operations Order also required that incident reports, field interview cards, after action reports and cost reports be written for this operation. The Department could not produce these reports and the officer designated to write the reports stated that he did not produce the reports. There i no documentation that showed how many individuals were subjected to testing, what types of testing occurred, or what the results of the tests were. There is no documentation to show that subject voluntarily submitted to these procedures. The named officer acknowledged that as the commanding officer, he was the person ultimately responsible for any violations of SFPD rules and regulations that occurred in the police district he supervised. A preponderance of the evidence proved the conduct complained of did occur, and using as a tandard the applicable regulations of the Department, the conduct was improper. \\x0c                             OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS DATE OF COMPLAINT: 02/11/14 DATE OF COMPLETION:                    01/29/15    PAGE #1 of 1',\n",

The named officer said he discussed the situation with the co-complainant, telling her that the subject needed to be given a verbal admonishment before she could sign a Citizen’s Arrest for trespassing. The officer said the co-complainant wanted the subject to go to jail immediately, but the officer explained that it did not work that way. He said that the co-complainant did not report a crime and did not request a report to be written. He denied that probable cause existed to make a private person’s arrest and stated that because the co-complainant did not go through with making one, no report was required. A witness officer said that the complainant told him she wanted the man to go to jail, but no crime had been committed so there was no reason to take the man to jail. He said they explained the citizen’s arrest process and the co-complainant didn’t want to go that route; she just wanted the man to go to jail.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: Department Bulletin No. 14-059, Traffic Stop Data Collection Program Information, issued on March 3, 2014, states in part:        Members are reminded to make all E585 entries after any vehicle stops related to the following        incidents:            •   Moving violations, including bicycles and pedestrian            •   -- The named officer stated that he did not enter the data because the complainant was not in a vehicle. He tated that this contact was not a vehicle stop because the person cited was on foot. While the bulletin does specifically mention pedestrians, the officer stated it was his understanding that traffic stop data need not be collected when stopping someone who is not in a vehicle. The evidence established that the officer’s explanation for not complying with Departmental Bulletin 14- 059 was reasonable in light of the Department Bulletin’s confusing language that requires E585 data entry after “any vehicle stop” without clarification that members are also required to make E585 entrie involving stops of bicyclists and pedestrians for moving violations. The OCC recommends that the Department revise Department Bulletin 14-059 so that it explains that traffic stop data collection includes vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle stops related to moving violations, MPC violations, Penal Code violations, Transportation Code violations, 916 vehicle and high-risk stops, mechanical or non-moving violations, DUI’s, traffic collisions, assistance to motorists, BOLO/APB/Warrants. \\x0c                                OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS DATE OF COMPLAINT: 01/15/15                DATE OF COMPLETION: 07/30/15              PAGE #1 of 1',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The named officer was a Field Training Officer (FTO) and responsible for the upervision of his assigned recruit. The recruit officer neglected his duty to properly investigate a juvenile vandalism case and failed to comply with numerous SFPD policies and procedures. The recruit wrote an inaccurate and incomplete incident report, containing numerous deficiencies. The deficiencies included failure to document language issues and juvenile notifications to the co-complainant. As the recruit’s FTO, the named officer did not address the recruit’s deficiencies for this case and incident report to insure that the recruit’s actions conformed with SFPD policies and procedures. The named officer thereby failed to properly complete his assignment as the senior officer and FTO in violation of DGO 2.01 and the FTO manual. The named officer also failed to set a professional example for his recruit at all times by not conforming his own actions to Department policies and procedures in violation of DGO’s 3.01, 5.20, 7.01 and the FTO Manual. The named officer denied the allegation. In his OCC interview, it was clear that the named officer lacked working knowledge of SFPD policies and procedures. The named officer sought to blame his recruit during his OCC interview for the deficiencies. As an example of the named officer’s lack of knowledge, he was asked about his knowledge regarding the DB for providing a Know Your Rights for Youth brochure to juveniles. His response was he was now aware of it, implying that the OCC interview brought this to his attention. He further insisted there were no additional witnesses to the incident although there were numerous parties on scene including one who stated that she told the officer she had knowledge of the crime. This witness was not listed in the incident report and no verbal or written statement was taken from this witness. The witness who had exculpatory information stated she was told by the officer to go back in her house. Another witness stated the officer told the exculpatory witness to mind her own business. The OCC interviewed an SFPD Subject Matter Expert (SME) regarding Field Training. The SME stated the FTO is responsible for all of their recruit’s actions and deficiencies. The FTO’s responsibility is to flag all of his recruit’s deficiencies, bring the recruit into compliance and lead by example. The SFPD Field Training Manual states FTOs should be willing to bear responsibility for the progress of the trainee or lack of it, until he or she is sure that other factors are the cause of the trainee’s performance. A preponderance of the evidence proved the conduct complained of did occur, and using as a standard the applicable regulations of the Department, the conduct was improper. \\x0c                                  OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS DATE OF COMPLAINT: 09/04/14               DATE OF COMPLETION:             08/18/15    PAGE #8 of 9',\n",

The named officer further stated in the report that the man began to walk away and he took him to the ground. A video of the man’s arrest, which recorded his conversation with the named officer, shows that the named officer never told the man he was taking him to jail for being intoxicated in public. The man also could not be heard speaking with profanity. The named officer, in an interview, stated that there were parts of the report that were out of sequence, and insisted that the detainee had whispered the profanity while holding his cell-phone where it would not pick up the insult. A witness who heard the conversation between the man and the named officer said the man used no profanity, and the officer did not tell the man he was being taken to jail, either before or after taking the man to the ground. Two witness officers and two civilians at the scene said they did not hear the conversation between the man and the named officer.

The complainant asked the responding officers to arrest the woman who had assaulted him. The woman was escorted out of the ballpark and the tadium staff requested the complainant be ejected as well. The officers detained and ejected the complainant out of the ballpark, after which they spoke to him about the assault. The officers stated that the complainant failed to cooperate and give them information related to the alleged assault, which was the basis for the citizen’s arrest. Because the complainant refused to cooperate, the officers determined that no citizen’s arrest was warranted and no incident report wa prepared. One of the named officers admitted that he heard the complainant say he wanted the woman arrested. Witnesses also confirmed the complainant’s request to arrest the woman.

An incident report by the named officer included allegations that the complainant directed statements such as, “fuck the police” for hassling about “bullshit” fare; “can’t you see it, asshole” and “fucking open it yourself, asshole” at the named officer while the named officer was conducting a fare inspection.

After completing his investigation, the named officer released the detainee but did not provide him with a Certificate of Release. The officer stated that he was not required to issue a Certificate of Release because handcuffing someone was not considered a “physical restraint” under the Department General Orders.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The complainant stated that, after honking and yelling at an older model, brown, Toyota Camry, the car pulled up behind him as he pulled to the curb. When the three occupants of the vehicle who were dressed in street clothes exited the vehicle, the complainant stated that he did not know the men were police officers. The named officers were acting undercover and part of the Muni Task Force. They were in plainclothe and driving an unmarked vehicle with tinted windows when they detained the complainant who had pulled his vehicle to the curb. The named officers issued the complainant a traffic citation for loud music and low tire tread and a parking citation for prohibited parking and parking more than 18 inches from the curb. Department General Order 9.01 states that “moving violations shall be enforced only by uniformed officers, except as provided in DGO 5.08, Non-Uniformed Officers.” Department General Order 5.08 tates that “non-uniformed officers shall not initiate traffic stops, issue traffic citations or make minor traffic arrests except ….[w]hen witnessing an aggravated situation requiring immediate action to protect life or property, e.g., drunk driving.” DGO 9.01 also states that “…members shall not let the attitude of a violator influence their enforcement action.” The named officers stated that the complainant’s driving created an aggravated situation that required the undercover officers’ immediate action to protect life or property. The named officers cited the complainant for loud music, low tire tread, prohibited parking and parking too far from the curb— infractions that do not reflect the officers’ account of dangerous driving. Additionally, one of the named officers initiated a DMV priority re-examination proceeding of the complainant for driver incapacity. Vehicle Code § 21061 permits an officer to issue a notice of DMV reexamination to a driver who shows signs of incapacity while committing a traffic violation. Evidence of incapacity is defined as evidence, other than violations of this division, of “serious physical injury or illness or mental impairment or disorientation that is apparent to the traffic officer…” (Vehicle Code §21061 (b)). The inconsistency between the driving the named officers reportedly witnessed and the infractions they issued in combination with initiating a priority re-examination proceeding without evidence of mental or physical incapacity and without providing the complainant proper notification as required by law have the hallmark of vindictive enforcement. The named officers’ enforcement actions against the complainant appear to be influenced by the complainant’s attitude toward the officers in violation of Department General Order 2.01, Rule 9 and DGO 9.01. A preponderance of the evidence proved that the conduct complained of did occur, and that, using as a standard the applicable regulations of the Department and tate law, the conduct was improper. \\x0c                                   OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS',\n",

The officer transported the complainant, a child, to the tation for additional investigation, which has a lockup for adults. One of the named officers stated once the victim identified the complainant and while still out at the cene, he contacted the complainant’s mother and advised her that the complainant would be transported to the city youth guidance center. The named officer stated his supervisor arrived and instructed him to transport the complainant to the station for further investigation. The supervisor, the second named officer, stated a reasonable effort was made to investigate the merits of the robbery at the incident scene. The supervisor stated due to the early morning hour, it was not reasonable, safe or advisable to conduct the rest of the robbery investigation in the field. The supervisor stated the area was not safe for the robbery victim or the juvenile robbery suspect. The incident report documented that the complainant was held in a non-secured location. The appropriate logs were completed and the complainant was searched, at which time, he was found to be wearing an ankle monitor bracelet. There was no evidence that the department order was violated in this incident. The evidence proved that the acts, which provided the basis for the allegation, occurred; however, such acts were justified, lawful, and proper. \\x0c                                OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS',\n",

A police officer may briefly detain a person for questioning or request identification only if the        officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person’s behavior is related to criminal activity.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The evidence established the named officer was serving as the Field Training Officer for a recruit officer. The evidence established the recruit officer pat searched the complainant despite the fact that he lacked an articulable basis for believing the complainant was armed and dangerous. The recruit officer stated that it was his practice to pat search anyone he detained or cited for an infraction. He also stated that during the period prior to this incident when the named officer was hi Field Training Officer, he conducted traffic stops on approximately twenty-five bicyclists, all of whom he pat searched. The recruit officer stated he pat searched each bicyclist because he believed bicyclists often carried tools such as screwdrivers (which potentially could be used as weapons) to repair their bicycles. The recruit officer did not cite anything specific about any of these bicyclists that made him suspect they might be armed. The named officer stated he was serving as the Field Training Officer for the recruit officer, who wa acting on his directions when he pat searched the complainant. The named officer stated there wa nothing specific about the complainant that made him suspect that he might be armed or might have a weapon. The named officer stated he had trained the recruit officer that he could pat search anyone he encountered who was wearing loose-fitting clothing that could potentially conceal a weapon. The evidence established the recruit officer and the named officer lacked an articulable basis for believing the complainant was armed and dangerous and, therefore, lacked justification to search the complainant. The named officer was supervising the recruit officer during the final phase of his Field Training. The training that the named officer gave to the recruit officer concerning circumstances when a pat search could be conducted was contrary to SFPD policies and procedures and to established case law. The evidence established that the named officer failed to ensure that his recruit officer complied with SFPD policies and with relevant law concerning pat searches. The evidence also established the recruit officer was responsible for making a Traffic Stop Data Collection Program entry for his traffic stop of the complainant, but failed to do so. As the recruit officer’s Field Training Officer, the named officer wa responsible for ensuring that the recruit officer complied with all Department regulations, including Department Bulletin 13-091, but failed to do so. A preponderance of the evidence proved that the conduct complained of did occur, and that using as a tandard the applicable regulations of the Department, the conduct was improper. \\x0c                                   OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS',\n",

At one point, one of the officers told the complainant’s friend to shut up or he would put her in the patrol car. One of the officers handcuffed the complainant’s friend and placed her in a police car. After the complainant’s friend protested that she was fearful of the two officers on the scene and did not want to go with them, another officer transported her to the station. One of the officers stated that he handcuffed the complainant’s friend for her own safety and because she repeatedly approached him and told him that what he was doing to the complainant was not right, and because she wasn’t listening to him. The second officer on the scene stated that he did not see the complainant’s friend getting handcuffed, but believes she was handcuffed because she was interfering with him and his partner as they moved the complainant to their patrol car. Communications records indicate that the complainant’s friend made two calls to 911 on her mobile phone to report that officers were hurting her friend and throwing her on the floor. One of the civilian witnesses at the scene stated that the complainant’s friend was calm and was not doing anything physically when she was handcuffed, although he thought she should have been handcuffed earlier. He stated that he had heard the complainant’s friend cursing and claiming that the officers beat up her friend.

The only available copy of the Incident Report for relevant case contains an officer declaration dated six weeks after the incident. The report tates that it is a “duplicate” of the original report. The Office of Citizen Complaints conducted interview of three San Francisco Police Department witnesses familiar with the San Francisco Police Department Record Management System (RMS) as well as the San Francisco Police Department server, which house reports transmitted from station data terminals. In conducting its investigation, the Office of Citizen Complaints queried the officer’s commanding officer as well as the local station captain for a copy of the original, but neither party had the purported original report. The Office of Citizen Complaints learned from the officer charged with managing the San Francisco Police Department server that the only report housed with the server was the report written six weeks after the event. The named officer stated that when Record Management System personnel could not find his report on file, he went to the local station to find out what happened to his original report. He asserted that the report might have been inadvertently deleted from the SFP-RMS system, so he wrote a “duplicate.” The commander of the Record Management System informed the Office of Citizen Complaints that the officer’s “duplicate” report was a likely a re-creation. Office of Citizen Complaints concluded that the officer likely did not err twice in one incident by both failing to properly transmit his report from the local station to the San Francisco Police Department server, and in failing to place his report in the lieutenant’s outbox.

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The complainant and a witness in this case stated that an officer who conducted a preliminary investigation into a sexual assault conducted the victim interview in a manner that offended the victim, and made him feel like he was being partially blamed for the attack that he had endured. Among the officer’s behaviors the victim complained about were repeated requests that the victim describe the graphic details of a violent sexual assault, questions about why the victim had not fought back or resisted his attacker, constant interruptions during the victim’s account of the crime, and explanations that the contentious questions were, “what you’re going to have to face when you get in front of a defense attorney.” The victim and the counselor who was with him during the interview stated that the officer’s actions resulted in an erosion in the victim’s confidence, and a perception that he was being blamed for the attack. The named officer denied making the alleged comments, but did acknowledge that she asked the victim about his resistance to the attack, which the officer said was necessary to establish a crime, had occurred. A witness officer denied that the named officer made any inappropriate comments. A trainer at the San Francisco Police Department Academy, told the Office of Citizen Complaints that he believed Sexual Assault training had been taught in the Academy since at least 1981, when he was a recruit, but said he believed that each instructor had his or her own curriculum in the area, at least until 1998, when the department implemented the Learning Domain Series of training exercises.

The retired Inspector is a 23-year veteran of the San Francisco Police Department and a former inspector in Sex Crimes, who now is a contract trainer for the Academy on Crisis Communications. The trainer told the Office of Citizen Complaints on September 1, 2005, that, as far as he knows, the only training officer in San Francisco receive is during recruit training, when there is a 2-hour block on sex crimes, of which 10-15 minutes deals with the interview of the victim. \\x0cContinued                        OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS DATE OF COMPLAINT: 01/24/05 DATE OF COMPLETION: 11/06/05 PAGE# 3 of 3 Asked to comment on the nature of the comments allegedly made to the victim in this incident, the retired Inspector said that each interview can require a different approach, and that he would be reluctant to say there is never a reason to engage in a particular line of questioning. As to questions of resistance and fighting off an attacker, the retired Inspector said that information can be important to an investigation, but there is always a gentle way of asking for it, suggesting the neutral, “what did you do? What happened next?” technique. The retired Inspector did say, “certain questions are going to be better avoided. For instance, the law i pretty clear in California that there does not need to be resistance, that it’s not even necessary [for a victim] to say, ‘No,’ for there to be the elements of an assault.” The retired Inspector added, however, “Patrol officers would not necessarily know that.” The retired Inspector suggested that, especially in San Francisco, where patrol officers usually conduct the preliminary interviews of sex assault victims, more specialized training should be provided in this area. \\x0c                                   OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: The officer failed to recognize the incident as one of domestic violence, and failed to set an example of leadership and performance for the sector officer he directly supervised. Hi performance lacked in the method he dealt with actual and potential witnesses, his failure to seek physical evidence, and his approach to the actual crime scene. The officer also left the scene prematurely, to the detriment of the investigation. The officer’s supervisory neglect also extended to a flawed review of hi upervisee’s incident report, for which he was the sergeant and acting lieutenant in charge of watch. The officer stated in his OCC interview that he had read it for accuracy and completeness. The officer pecifically stated in his interview that if there had been something to add to the report, he would have told his supervisee to add it to the report. However, the report contained numerous factual and clerical errors that were not harmless errors. The report contained multiple omissions of facts that when read, would clearly put the reader on notice that crucial information was missing from the report. The OCC added allegation is sustained. \\x0c                                OFFICE OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS',\n",

ACTION: FINDINGS OF FACT: There was no evidence in either the officer’s CAD printout or in the CAD audio that the officer sought supervisory approval for the administrative tow. Moreover, since there was no requirement for an Incident Report due to the tow’s administrative nature, there was no written means to verify department supervisory approval of this tow. The Office of Citizen Complaints reviewed the evidence with the named officer and explained the OCC added allegation. The officer explained that he asked for and received supervisor approval of the vehicle tow from his supervisor from a department issued mobile telephone, which also functions as a walkie-talkie. There was no independent means to prove or disprove the OCC added allegation.',\n",

The officers also stated that the passengers in the vehicle were detained for a minimal time and then free to go if they had wanted.

The officers stated that none of these requirements were met and that no certificates of release were necessary. One passenger stated that she was handcuffed but all officers denied that anyone except the arrested complainant was handcuffed. None of the passengers were moved from the scene of the contact. The time requirement is not met as the officers stated that they conducted the traffic stop in a reasonable and necessary amount of time. There were no independent witnesses to this contact.
